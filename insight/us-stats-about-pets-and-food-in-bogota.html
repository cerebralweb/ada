              Left Hand of Darkness</em>
          </p>
        

        <p>
          <dfn>In Colombia, pets have become a central element of the family basket .</dfn>
          In Bogotá - capital of Colombia and target of this study - today it is common to
            find people walking with "breed" dogs or raising cats. This is a relatively new
            trend. 10 or 15 years ago there was a clear distinction between "breed" dog
          owners and "creole" dog owners: the former were expensive and were a status symbol of
          upper-class families while the latter used to belong to lower-income families. Pets are
          therefore still a status symbol, but their use - especially of dogs and cats - has become
          widespread. </p>

        <p> The role of pets in families has also changed. From external guardians they became
          members of the family. One of the consequences is that the relationship with pets became
          an element to take into account in consumption decisions. But beware! Having a pet does
          not necessarily change consumption preferences. It would be thought that having more
          interest in animals would make people more prone to abandon consumption associated with
          animal pain (eating meat, for example), but this is not the case. <dfn><strong>In general,
              the data from our study shows that the criteria for consuming have not been
              particularly affected by having a pet.</strong></dfn> </p>

        <div class="bannerTwitero">

          <h2>The consumer's lifestyle tells us how to sell to him </h2>

          <p><dfn>The modern consumer has a way of presenting himself to society, that is, a way of
              saying <em>who he is,</em> what sets him apart from others, <em>where he comes from
              </em>. It does this using its body as a vehicle of communication. </dfn> With what
            elements does the consumer build his lifestyle?:
          <ol class="triangle">
            <li> What do you eat? How do you eat it? </li>
            <li> What clothes do you wear? What accessories?</li>
            <li>How does he speak? </li>
            <li>What brands do you use?</li>
            <li>Where do you want to be seen?</li>
            <li>What college do you go to?</li>
            <li>Where do I dwell?</li>
            <li>What furniture do you have?</li>
            <li>Where do you travel?</li>
            <li>And of course: do you want to be seen in the company of an animal?</li>
          </ol>
          </p>

          <p class="highlight"><strong>Segments</strong> mentioned in this item</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Consumers with pets in Bogotá </h2>

        <p> Our study was carried out among people who have a pet and live in Bogotá (let's
          emphasize: all those involved in the study have a pet and live in Bogotá ). <dfn>When we
            say that someone is an animalist we mean that they publicly support ideas associated
            with animalism.</dfn> </p>

        <div>

          <h2>Eat meat?</h2>

          <img src="/charts/mascotasBogotaCharts/comoCarne.svg"
               alt="gráfico de barras: 76% de la muestra come carne">
          
          

          <p> It is not surprising that in a population of people with pets the majority eat meat
            (76%). This reaffirms the hypothesis that the pet is a member of the family:
            <strong>people empathize with it for being part of the family, not for being an
              animal.</strong> </p>
        </div>

        <div>

          <h2>Non-meat-eating animalists vs. non-meat-eating animalists </h2>

          <img src="/charts/mascotasBogotaCharts/esAnimalistaComeCarne.svg"
               alt="0 % de los que no son animalistas deja e comer carne">
          
          <p> This graph suggests that <strong>there is a case where ideas become important in
              purchases: defending animalistic ideas lowers the propensity to buy meat,</strong>
            probably due to a guilt / empathy effect that non-animalists don't feel when they go to
            the supermarket. (By the way: 56% of our population defends animalistic ideas) </p>

          <p> <dfn>Cat owners are slightly more likely not to eat meat and spread animalistic
              ideas:</dfn> the percentage of those who have a cat and do not eat meat is 29%, vs.
            19% of those who have a dog and do not eat meat. Apparently, <dfn><strong>people who
                have a cat are a little more inclined to intellectual reflection (they ask about the
                meaning of their purchases, before, during and after).</strong></dfn> Coherently,
            55% of cat owners are animalistic, vs. 45% in dog owners. </p>
        </div>

        <div>

          <h2>How old are you? Eat meat? </h2>

          <p> While 19% of Millennials who have pets do not eat meat, in Generation Z that
            percentage is 0%. This suggests that while the increase in age helps to arouse interest
            in other diets,<strong> having pets is not the strongest driver in the vegan and
              vegetarian segments</strong> (not yet). </p>

          <img src="/charts/mascotasBogotaCharts/porEdadComeCarne.svg"
               alt="0 % de los que no son animalistas deja e comer carne">
        </div>

        <div>

          <h2>Is there a global demand for meat that is not meat? </h2>

          <p> Finding the universal in the particular is the greatest achievement of an insight.
            That and figuring out how to use insight to build successful businesses. And <dfn>what
              is a successful business if not a string of sales of a product that really solves a
              human (or animal!) Problem?</dfn> And there is no need to hesitate about whether the
            problem is "real" or "imaginary": <strong>if the consumer feels that something is a
              problem that something <em>is</em> a problem, and those who solve it will make
              money)</strong> . </p>

          <p>The thing is that many consumption problems are a mixture of imaginary things (that is,
            they are a product of how our way of perceiving something changes, for example, food,
            animals, the environment) and real things (for example, obesity in countries where the
            middle classes grow). </p>

          <p> Searching for the universal in the particular can be the key to creating a successful
            sales strategy or business model. The reason is clear: <dfn>we live in a connected
              economy, in which the consumer preferences of local customer communities connect in
              real time via the Internet and are analyzed with data science technologies.</dfn> An
            artificial intelligence model develops a shopping prediction method used in Brazil,
            created with data from China and India, a consumer in Ecuador watches an English
            consumer "hack" about a crib made in Vietnam, a Colombian child learns math in a Website
            designed by an Indian engineer who lives in California and works with money donated by
            Microsoft.

          <p>

          <p> KFC will help us bring this insight from the particular to the universal. Let's see.
            In February, the company launched <strong>a campaign in Atlanta that had a major impact
              in that category.</strong> Vegan fried chicken would be sold. The brand's stores had a
            considerable influx of people who wanted their
            fried-chicken-not-to-be-chicken-but-to-taste-like-chicken. </p>
          <iframe class="youtubeVideo" width="560" height="315"
                  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hoFENzwI_ZQ?start=35controls=0&branding=0&cc_load_policy=0&controls=0&fs=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=0&playsinline=1&quality=hd720&rel=0&showinfo=0&wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1"
                  frameborder="0"
                  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                  allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <p> The idea of ​​the campaign was not based solely on "the data" of the company. For
            years (since the 1990s) KFC's market research teams tracked the topic with qualitative
            and ethnographic research. They found that the spread of environmental discourse and
            obesity issues (and perhaps also the bad name of fast food brands, compounded by stories
            of mutant chickens and cows, invented in secret labs) had built new needs. Partly
            "imaginary", and partly "real". <strong>Market research gradually found that many people
              wanted a chicken that was not chicken,</strong> I mean, they didn't want to stop
            eating chicken, but they wanted to stop eating chicken; really </p>

          <p> Solution: A B2B alliance with a laboratory that was investigating how to make chicken
            meat that was not chicken , but "vegan". And something important: the product must taste
            like chicken, not chickpea, or whatever. </p>

          <p> Volviendo a Atlanta, año 2019 (hasta en la comida los 1990 fueron una era oscura).
            ¿Cuál es la realidad? Es decir, los que corrieron a los locales de KFC a comer pollo
            vegano, <strong>¿qué comían? Comían pollo (recuerden que el producto <em>sabía</em> a
              pollo)</strong>; pero estaban en contra de comer pollo (recuerden que el motivo de
            consumo era la promesa de una comida vegana). </p>

          <p > Returning to Atlanta, 2019 <strong></strong>. What is the(even in food,
            the 1990s were a dark era) reality? That is to say, those who ran to the KFC premises to
            eat vegan chicken, what did they eat? They ate chicken (remember that the product tasted
            like chicken); but they were against eating chicken (remember that the reason for
            consumption was the promise of a vegan meal). </p>

          <p> And back to our insight on the Bogota consumer. <strong>Buying a pet is not an
              experience that leads to veganism.</strong> The consumer is left with a love for their
            animal and a taste for real meat, as long as there is no better option (KFC chicken-pea?
            If so, we will see it soon in Bogotá). Meat consumption is culturally and genetically
            rooted. The generalization of pet ownership is one of the first steps to empathize with
            animals, that is, <strong>one of the first steps towards a new family basket.</strong>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bannerTwitero" id="insight">

          <h2> What insights did we extract from the first report? </h2>

          <p>Pet owners empathize with them for being family, not for being an animal. An animal
            sales strategy focused on new values ​​such as animalism is still touching delicate
            cultural fibers. </p>

          <p>In this context, the cost of pet products is secondary: between price, product and
            promotion, you have to choose a product. </p>

          <p>Quitting to meat does not have a positive correlation with having a pet in any age
            group. </p>

          <p>The generalization of pets and the refusal to abandon meat consumption suggest at least
            two business opportunities: the humanization of pets through exclusive products, and the

          <p> The distinction between the imaginary part and the real part of a consumer's needs can
            have a lucrative side. If data science and market research find a way to process that
            distinction, we can have insights and sales strategies with the precision of the most
            complex machine we can imagine. </p>

          <p>The insights in this article are based on 30% of the study carried out, so we will have
            to wait to see how they connect with the following reports. </p>

          <p>In the last installment we will explain the methodology used in the study. </p>
