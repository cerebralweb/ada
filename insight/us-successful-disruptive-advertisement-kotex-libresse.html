                <p><em><span style="color: rgb(248, 156, 8);">In this article ❧ </span>We tell how the advertising of sanitary pads
                        changed (from blue blood to red), and explains that this change was based on insights related to consumer shame, guilt and
                        taboo</dfn></em></p>

    <p> Years ago I teach anthropology at a medicine school. Social science concepts are
                    difficult for students, so I tried to illustrate them with everyday situations;
                    Advertising and market research provide excellent inputs for this purpose. On
                    one occasion I took to class <strong>“The Story of Menstruation”</strong>, an
                    animated short that Walt Disney produced under the auspices of
                    <strong>Kotex</strong> in 1946. The result was not what I expected, but I am
                    sure of something: my students were not bored with that class; and they will no
                    longer see Kotex advertising with the same eyes. </p>

                <h2>Kotex takes a step forward</h2>
                <p> The original goal of the short film was to expose a normal physiological process
                    to a teenage audience in a fairly conservative country at the time. It was not
                    obvious that the short was also a form of soft selling: <strong>Kotex financed
                        the short to sell menstrual pads without mention menstrual pads.</strong>
                    This is demonstrated by the brochure that accompanied the video ( <a
                       href="/pdfs/Very-Personally-Yours.pdf">“Very Personally Yours”</a> ) that
                    directly promoted Kotex products. </p>

                     alt="folleto de Kotex año 1946">
                <p> My students' reactions were mixed. Some viewed the video with sympathy for
                    presenting useful and “fact-based” information; others expressed annoyance at a
                    speech that forced women to put on their "prettiest face," even in "those days."
                    Only one thing went unnoticed: the blood of the period was blue. <strong>The
                        advertising of sanitary pads and tampons has repeatedly shown us this image:
                        Blood that is not blood.</strong> Today, 74 years after that Walt Disney
                    short, television commercials offer increasingly thinner and ergonomic products
                    with greater ability to absorb ... a blue liquid.
                <p> It is not uncommon for menstrual flow to be simulated in this way, as
                    menstruation has historically been associated with infertility, impurity, or
                    anger. (Which woman has not been told that "she is in her days" when she is
                    angry). </p>
                <p> The "blue blood" of menstruation - which has nothing to do with royalty - has
                    become a visual code. It has become so obvious that menstruation "is blue," that
                    none of my medical students noticed. Eventually, I said to them myself, and the
                    first thing they said was "Nosotras!" (the name the brand of Libresse has in
                    Colombia) And then they remembered that the advertising of this brand dared to
                    make visible what was obvious without being it: menstruation is red. </p>
                <iframe class="youtubeVideo" width="560" height="315"
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o6DOrrF9D9w?controls=0&branding=0&cc_load_policy=0&controls=0&fs=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=0&playsinline=1&quality=hd720&rel=0&showinfo=0&wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1"

                <p> Bodyform (the English brand for Libresse) did a great campaign to break taboos
                    and connect women globally. They found that everything related to the periods
                    triggered shame, disgust and rejection. <strong>The insight was that brands that
                        offered solutions for women's periods systematically avoided
                        reality,</strong> thereby helping to perpetuate shame. In this situation,
                    Bodyform assumed the responsibility of removing the stigmas of the periods. At
                    the same time, they saw an opportunity to gain visibility, respect, and
                    <strong>increased participation in a market dominated by Always and
                        Tampax.</strong>
                </p>
                <p> The creative idea was this: aggressive shock tactics or simple reporting would
                    change nothing. "To assert the right of periods to be and feel normal, we had to
                    be the normality we wanted to see." Hence #bloodnormal emerged. Bodyform ran a
                    campaign on social networks and taking advantage of the rejection caused by
                    menstruation, he did creative judo to gain visibility. Thus, it was sought to
                    create a new paradigm of normality and positivity, in which women could stop
                    feeling unpleasant and men disgusted. </p>
                <p> The strategy worked. In the last three years, Bodyform <a
                       href="/pdfs/126852_Bodyform_Libresse__bloodnorma.pdf">sales</a> in Europe
                    decreased 0.5%, <strong>while P&G grew</strong>. But where #bloodnormal was
                    promoted (Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, UK, France), <strong>Bodyform increased
                        its market share by an average of 1.4%.</strong>
                </p>
                <p> In Colombia, they launched the hashtag #ElRojoNoMeSonroja in order to create a
                    space for dialogue on menstruation. In general, the decision to change the blue
                    liquid for red, was applauded. Many Colombians expressed messages of relief on
                    social networks. </p>

                    <dfn><strong>Advertising becomes disruptive when it highlights uncomfortable or
                            ignored realities.</strong> </dfn> In this case the fact of the blood of
                    the period is not unnoticed: the bold, the creative, the profitable, the
                    disruptive thing was to show that the blood of the period is red. </p>
                <p> Brands sell much more than a product. <strong>Their advertising shows us images
                        and concepts that come to feel so real, that it seems that only advertising
                        itself is capable of undoing them. </strong> This "reality" that builds
                    advertising can become so normalized that it can also be a blind spot for
                    advertisers and marketing managers. It is through judicious consumer research
                    that insights can be discovered to illuminate those blind spots. </p>

                <p>
                    <dfn>Advertising campaigns that show a more real point of view have caused a
                        stir. </dfn> An example is Billie and her #projectbodyhair. These feminine
                    hair removal products dared to show women with hair. This marked a distance from
                    the typical advertisements for waxing and shavers presented by hairless models.
                    And it's not that we suddenly realized that women have hair, but that a blind
                    spot was revealed. Presenting explicitly and real female body hair was what I
                    liked the most. In this way, it was possible to show empathy. Consumers were
                    able to identify with the protagonists of Billie's campaign, instead of feeling
                    bad about not even looking like the “before” of the commercials. </p>

                     alt="foto de redes sociales">
                <p> Another brand that has opted for "real women" is Dove. All of them, regardless
                    of size, age, skin color, hair texture, all have a "beauty potential" that Dove
                    invites you to discover through its products. Without models, without photoshop,
                    only flesh and blood women. But Dove wants to go further and take real women to
                    another level. The #ShowUs project seeks to create, together with Getty Images
                    and Girlgaze, a library of photographs of real women, made by them on their own
                    terms. Thus, it seeks to break stereotypes and redefine beauty. <strong> With
                        this bookstore, the media and advertisers have available a collection of
                        photographs that pretends to be an authentic representation.</strong>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Being 100% powered by women both in front of and behind the scenes</li>

                <p> Many have celebrated that these brands show a "more human" side of women:
                    <dfn>the new advertising fact seems to be that the more "imperfect" one is, the
                        more beautiful it is. Perhaps having more achievable beauty models
                        represents a relief for those who have been measured with <strong>the
                            demanding bar of advertising for feminine products.</strong></dfn>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <dfn>Disruptive advertising captures the charm of the real and manages to
                        express it in its messages. Thus, brands not only sell their products, but
                        also defy stereotypes that traditional advertising has spread, and help to
                        show other ways of seeing and understanding the world. <strong>Brands become
                            an inspiration rather than an aspiration.</strong></dfn>

                    <h2>Highlights on disruptive advertising: </h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Advertising contributes to creating ideas, images and concepts about
                            reality. </li>
                        <li>The communication codes generated and / or promoted by advertising are
                            not immutable.</li>
                        <li>Advertising can be disruptive when "blind spots" are identified and
                            brands propose a different way of looking at the world.</li>
                        <li>Research is essential to generate insights capable of identifying those
                            "blind spots"</li>
