                    Marketing directors: think twice before cutting the market research and advertising budget during the
                    times of crisis we are living. Remember, first of all, that consumer goods (the core of retail) are considered
                    recession proof, provided that the relationship between context (crisis), price and quality is well managed.
                    Second,
                    remember that a crisis also creates business opportunities. And most importantly, remember that <dfn>
                        <strong>"the user," "the
                            customer," "the consumer," is ultimately a human being who feels a great desire to be interpreted:
                            The</strong> crisis is the most
                        favorable situation to prove your loyalty for this premise. They, the buyers, will know how to recognize
                        this and will
                        appreciate it ... buying ... or helping the brand to grow through good vibes sent in the word of mouth of
                        everyday life.</dfn>
                </p>

                <div class="popup" onclick="myFunction()">

                    </span>
                </div>

                <h2>What a crisis is?</h2>

                <p>
                    <dfn>A crisis can be a recession, that is, a period of time of several months in which negative numbers are
                        presented in
                        general indicators of the economy. Sometimes recessions are cyclical, that is, they occur every certain
                        number of years
                        (usually every 10) as a result of a stagnation of demand, or due to the impact of structural phenomena,
                        for example, the
                        growing trade deficit in the United States in front of China.</dfn>
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, there may not be a recession and still there will be a crisis. That is the case of social unrest seen
                    in recent
                    years in countries such as Brazil, Chile, Argentina and, now Colombia. In these cases, curiously, the
                    <dfn>social conflict is
                        facilitated by previous cycles of moderate economic growth</dfn> (Colombia, unlike other Latin American
                    countries, tends to
                    grow steadily - even when the others do not grow - but always in a very moderate way).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <dfn>How does this last form of social crisis work? Economic growth allows consumption expectations to grow
                        and education
                        coverage to increase. When these expectations (pension, stable employment, housing, etc.) are not
                        fulfilled, citizens
                        who are dissatisfied and with more critical ideas (the product of education) take the streets, and the
                        crisis arises,
                        from nowhere.</dfn>
                </p>


                <div class="bannerTwitero">
                    <h2>Why are crises relevant to brands? </h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>They affect the demand for some goods</li>
                        <li>Brands are public referents of identity</li>
                        <li>People always expect their symbolic referents to shed light on problems. Brands are important
                            references such as religion or politics.</li>
                        <li>During crises, collective thinking is more prone to change the meaning of things: things like brands,
                            which can be placed on a pedestal, or repudiated, overnight; a political party is also a brand</li>

                <h2>Budget reductions do not work in the long term</h2>
                <p>
                    Saving is almost always prudent (sometimes spending a lot is also prudent); cutting expenses is inevitable
                    when a crash
                    plan is executed. However, <dfn>in long periods of time the lack of marketing and advertising weakens the
                        health of the brand
                        and market share.</dfn> Nick Parsons argued that sometimes it is worth going against what the masses
                    usually think about
                    crises. He studied several cases in which advertisers increased, maintained or reduced their advertising
                    budgets. In all
                    cases, there was a decrease in short-term ROI. However, <strong>those who maintained or increased advertising
                        and research
                        spending gained market share by at least half a percentage point once the crisis ended.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another example: in the midst of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession">global recession
                        of
                        2008</a>,Procter & Gamble and Unilever decided to keep spending on marketing, advertising and market
                    research. These
                    companies understood that the recession was an opportunity to gain market share at the expense of the weakest
                    companies,
                    which chose to reduce expenses in these areas.
                </p>


                <ul>
                    <h2>In a pre-crisis state brands must: </h2>

                    <li>Tailor its strategy for each platform and channel and avoid a unique approach</li>
                    <li>Continue investing in a highly distinctive brand, with its own visual identity based on a color palette,
                        product photos, logos and aesthetic and textual features that create distinction</li>
                    <li>avoid confusing the brand with performance metrics</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Before a recession comes, brands must think of strategies on how to tackle the problem. But that can be done
                    creatively.
                    Bryan Mattimore, co-founder of Growth Engine Innovation Agency, leads clients to what he calls "wargame
                    sessions" to
                    prepare them for crises. The roles that players assume during the workshops are not only direct competitors,
                    but also
                    companies that could become new rivals. The goal is to anticipate the worst scenarios and create strategies to
                    deal with
                    them.
                </p>

                <h2>Information is power: be recursive</h2>

                <p>
                    Remember that information is a scarce, valuable, spared resource. Information is the best tool to plan and
                    make
                    difficult decisions. Try to understand the value that consumers give the brand so that it is in a better
                    position when
                    creating strategies and innovations; use previous market studies, metrics and qualitative lightning studies.
                    Have
                    suppliers of different profiles, in case you need to consider low budgets in advertising, marketing and market
                    research.
                    Try to imagine all the scenarios and create strategies to deal with them. Continually <strong>review sales
                        reports to learn
                        about consumer trends</strong>. Organize meetings between manufacturers and retail customers to share
                    ideas about new products,
                    promotions and marketing campaigns: <strong>create value for others, without always expecting direct
                        retribution. Think about
                        how your brand can help relieve consumer anxiety</strong> in general. Create a butterfly effect.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <dfn>"Be sensitive to your clients' difficulties," says David Reibstein, a marketing professor at the Wharton
                        School of the
                        University of Pennsylvania. "If you identify with them, they will be more likely to identify with
                        you."</dfn> Example: In
                    2009, during the Great Recession, Hyundai Motor America introduced a new "Warranty" program that allowed new
                    car buyers
                    and renters to obtain a new warranty. The company would buy its vehicle again up to one year after the
                    original
                    purchase, paying a maximum of $ 7,500 of the cost of depreciation, <strong>if the client lost his job within
                        that
                        period.</strong> Customers could also ask the company to take care of their car payments for 90 days while
                    looking for work:
                    without demanding money back. The announcement included television commercials and online advertisements with
                    headlines
                    such as "We support you for a full year" and "Guarantee: certainty in times of uncertainty." The result?
                    Hyundai
                    surpassed other automakers in February 2009. This campaign "distinguished them as <strong>a company that
                        placed customers first,</strong>
                    above their profits," Reibstein analyzes. As the economy began to recover in 2011, the program gradually
                    withdrew.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brands can also combine empathy with an understanding of customer behavior. When money is scarce,
                    <dfn>consumers tend to make
                        certain predictable changes in their buying habits, for example they eat less.</dfn> For food companies,
                    that requires
                    promotions and campaigns that not only take advantage of these behavioral patterns, but do so in solidarity.
                    Another
                    example: during the Great Recession of 2008, Kraft published more recipes with Kraft products on its website
                    and on
                    social networks. In a recession, people have less money and feel fear: brands can help relieve that anxiety;
                    <dfn>Psychology
                        has discovered that a simple way to do this is to build a sense of control based on knowledge of the
                        situation </dfn>(just as
                    Kraft did).

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            During the 2008 recession Hyundai promised to assume part of the debt of a new car buyer if he was
                            unemployed. Result: 10% more sales during 2009, compared to its competitors.
                        </li>
                        <li>In the same year Kraft developed and published hundreds of recipes based on the brand's economic
                            products, with the aim of helping to lighten the anxiety of middle and lower class consumers</li>
                        <li>Unliver maintained its spending on market research and advertising in the midst of this crisis,
                            calculating that the ROI of what was spent would be even greater, because some competitors would stop
                            investing in those items to save money.</li>
