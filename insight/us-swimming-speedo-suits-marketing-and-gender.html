        <p><em><span style="color: rgb(248, 156, 8);">In this article ❧ </span> speedo's strategy is safe but it is lagging behind market
            trends. We analyze the gender and design strategy in products Speedo for boys and girls. </em> </p>

        <p>
          The design of this report did not start in the usual way. Usually, the Hexis team meets to update our publishing strategy.
          However, <strong> the idea of writing about Speedo came up in one of the brand's stores </strong>. We were not in a business
          visit, or researching (we would like that): we were buying swimming accessories for one of us: of us needed to buy something for
          his daughter. And it was in that context, examining tags prices, fins, sticky shoes, shark caps, magnifying glasses (yes,there are
          magnifying glasses for swimming for people with myopia). Seeing all those things, the idea came up, the idea of doing a little
          study on <strong> Speedo Product Design Strategy </strong>, and more specifically about possible feelings that its gender strategy
          could cause in parents.</p>

        <p > Josefina, 35 years old, separated, one son, merchant, own a middle class home, studying business
          administration. </p>
        <p> Yes brands: middle class consumers are increasingly concerned about equality. Many studies point that consumer taste is
          increasingly inclined to consider gender elements in processes of decide what and where to buy </p>
        <p> With these concepts in mind, the topic was discussed at our editorial meeting and the next plan research. </p>
        <h2> Steps of the investigation </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Exploratory statistical inquiry. </li>
          <li> Focus group and semi-structured interview with two parents, with young children who practice swimming. </li>
          <li> Insight. </li>
        </ul>

        <p> How to sell <strong> a generation of parents increasingly concerned about equality gender </strong>? In This studio We analyze
          products from a line of Speedo, a popular brand of swimming accessories. For the investigation we use techniques quantitative
          and qualitative, which we explain to continuation. </p>

          <h2> Features of Speedo that both segments like equally </h2>
          <li> Manufacturing quality. </li>
          <li> Brand value. </li>
          <li> Access to Speedo stores. </li>
          <li> Cost (although there were some reservations about the duration of materials in chlorine pools).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Ethnography: the busiest pool in Bogotá </h2>
        <p> How to get two mothers of middle or upper middle class, who have sons or daughters small, who practice swimming, and were they
          going to collaborate in our research? The question had a concrete answer: Compensar,
          <a href="https://deportes.compensar.com/Canchas-Piscinas/pr%C3%A1ctica-libre-de-nataci%C3%B3n-piscina-ol%C3%ADmpica-tarifa-especial-martes-pnatpolmts_z01">
            Olimpic swimming pools of the CUR </a>, in Bogotá. This place is probably the most popular in Bogotá at the time to swim.
            Every day dozens - maybe hundreds - of children take classes, so is was going to not be difficult to know persons like the
            ones we wanted to interview. </p>  


            <h2> Stage: What are the swimsuit for? </h2>
            <p> The aquatic complex has two large areas. We chose the "Olympic 1" area, as it is the most complex area (it houses three
              swimming pools). </p>
            <p> Each of the three pools mentioned has a specialty: older adults, classes of swimming and playing. </p>
            <p>We discard the first one because only incidentally there are children in it. In the second (a swimming pool divided laterally
              into lanes of 25 meters) there is a lot of children's activity. Groups between 5 to 20 <span> children </span> receive <span>
                classes </span> led by uniformed instructors. </p>

                <div id="insight" class="bannerTwitero">
                  <h2> Insight </h2>  <strong> Speedo </strong>: We have seen that there are two audiences and that each one can be served with
                    a relative different idea. On one hand, we have buyers who are not very sensitive to gender ideas; they could be parents of
                    children; on the other side, we have fathers and mothers (especially mothers with a certain educational profile) interested in
                    gender equity.

        <h4> Swimming suits in economically differentiated segments </h4>
        <p> The ages of the students range from 4 to 15 years. Their swimming suits follow a clear logic: the students who come from
          public schools wear generic suits, no particular brand, and, in somecases, garments that are not even for swimming. In contrast,
          students who pay for private classes use brand costumes;<strong> the special design does not seem to have any impact on sports
            practice (moreover: the attention that swimming demands it is such that only a trained eye could recognize such distinctions)
          </strong> </p>
        <ul>
          <h2> Profile for the focus group </h2>
          <li> Age 25 to 45 years. </li>
          <li> Parents of children who go to the pool at least twice a month. </li>
          <li> With university studies. </li>
          <li> With an observable, middle-class lifestyle. </li>
          <li id="dos"> Who knew brands like Speed or Arena. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Results of a focus group </h2>
        <p> Josefina and Erica - our two interviewees - are mothers of a 6-year-old boy (swimmis five times a week and takes part of the
          Compensar team) and a 9-year-old girl (also a member of the swimming teams). The first adore Speedo's designs, the second
          stopped buying the brand for not matching their ideas about equity of gender </p>

        <h2> Business opportunities in the children and sports segment </h2>
        <p> What is the value proposition in Speedo's design? Simply, it's about delivering quality in materials, comfort, colors,
          textures, safety, and even fun (if we consider, for example the creation of a visual identity based on a proposal of <em>
            cartooning </em> for packaging.That is what is visible.But in Speedo's value proposition there is also a meta-discourse, a
          message whose meaning makes sense when the consumer connects it with more or less generalized social models of thinking.<strong>
            Speedo raises a clear message: boys are tough and girls are tender </strong>. And there is a problem. Well the mindset of the
          Middle-class consumers - increasingly educated and more cosmopolitan- no longer associate kids with something active and girls
          with something passive. </p>

            <ul>
              <li> Practice swimming: it is a great sport.
              <li> <strong> Don't forget that ideas change, and brands must change with them. </strong>. Is very probable that Erika
                re-approach a prestigious brand like Speedo when she feels reflected in it. </li>
              <li> Investigate, Investigate ... Investigate. Your competition does, too. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> BONUS !!!!!! </h2>
            <p> Aware of the growing interest in netnography, we selected two videos. The first allows
              think about
              What are they
              different boys and girls when it comes to swimming, and what not. The second is a video of a girl of 7
              years
              competing (in the
              roughest style: butterfly):
