              <p>
                The power of Facebook is not limited to <strong>traditional advertising</strong> and marketing. Many brands fish with
                dynamite in that
                social network, but there are also many brands that <dfn>  publish --or encourage the publication of--
                    contents that
                     subtly position their products, without appearing to be selling</dfn>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond recipes and Best Sellers,  how does content marketing really work.
                 Let's see an specific case: an online community on Facebook, whose target are matured, middle class men, to whom digital camera gear
                 is a must have (since they are amateur digital photographers)
              </p>
            
              <h2> Target segment: mature men with money ... who consume <em> content </em> on Facebook </h2>
            
              <p> Men of <em> Generation X </em> (between 36 to 55 years old), with purchasing power, have a
          growing interest in 
          hobbies like photography. If we focus on the segments with professional and postgraduate education, which have
          developed
          long trajectories in companies, or in the exercise of professions such as medicine, we find
          that the majority have a medium income and that are inclined to get involved in
            a hobby, if it promises considerable  <strong>relief from work stress or a fantasy realization </strong>.
          In Colombia, <a class="blue-marker"
             href = "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=16&ved=2ahUKEwjJh8uvr-zjAhVCuVkKHZsiBKUQFjAPegQIAxAC&url=https%3A%2F% % 3FidFile% 3D231472 & usg = AOvVaw1FQKfw687AokfD79AFpqkW & cshid = 1565030275831980 "> less
            than 58% of </a> middle and hight income adult, men and women, are inclined to gambling (41
          % of these
          , however, do that occasionally);  <a class="blue-marker"
               href = "/ pdfs / studio-games-of-chance-colgames-brand-strat-colombia.pdf"> only 15% </a> associates it with
            get out of the
            routine. 
        </p>
        <p>
          At the opposite extreme we have even lower numbers.  When they pass the 40-year-old barrier,
            Colombians go less to the movies (<a class="blue-marker"
               href = "https://www.dane.gov.co/files/investigaciones/eccultulral/bole_ecc_2017.pdf"> 28.6% in the segment
              from 41 to 64 years old </a> 
          , against 49% in the segment from 26 to 40 years). The same thing happens with reading but in an attenuated way
          (40% vs. 49%, respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is clear that <strong> gambling is very risky </strong>, and that movies or books are too safe. Hard hobbies are thus an alternative
          intermediate; and in
          the age of the Internet  the best place to extract insights about hobbies are communities
            online. The reasons are
          several, but they are summarized in one: free and dense exchange of information. All the tools
          
          Internet (forums, image, video, chats, downloads, anonymity) make it easy for those who enter the world of a hobby
          stay there for a long time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a class="blue-marker" href="https://www.flickr.com"> Flickr </a> and <a class="blue-marker" href="https://www.brothers-brick.com"> The Brothers Brick </a>
           are excellent
          examples. The first was for years the best website
          for photography hobbyists (and for market photographic products); and the second the site
          number one for the adult lego fan segment. <strong> Does it happen
             in Colombia? </strong>Are there colossal online communities, focused on a product segment, from which insights can be extracted? Yes, and the rest
          of this text is dedicated to one of them.

          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/139626896809987/about/"> Let's Learn Photography </a> was created on Facebook

          It has 152,226 members. For comparison, the Brothers-brick Facebook page has twice, but
         it is older. When visiting the Information of the community the first thing that jumps out is the abundance of rules.
          They are a
          total of 24 prohibitions and there is even one that is repeated twice: "no nudity". They are also not allowed
          links nor
          sales. However, in this case the interpretation suggests that the prohibitions precisely point out
          practices that are
          frequent in the group. In other words, although they do not post nude, erotic content is posted
          constantly and,
          <strong> although people can't sell, all the time people sell. </strong>

        <h2> From shopping center marketing to content marketing </h2>


        <p>
          <q>
            I bought my first camera at <a href="https://www.salitreplaza.com.co"> Salitre Plaza </a>. My wife wanted
            that
            we had something decent <strong> to take pictures of our dogs </strong>. She did not like the idea
            that we took photos with a
            Nokia. I think it was because her dad was a journalist and she had a dark room in her house; a big house
            
            in Nice.
          </q>
        </p>
        <p>
          <q>
            What brand it was. It was a Sony Mavica, a weird camera. I bought it at Fotojapon. Then I realized two
            stuff. One, that when I bought it that was already an outdated technology, and another that the price I had paid was
            absurd, no
            only because it was obsolete but because its price in dollars was much more
            low-.
          </q>

        <img class = "responsiveImageComGif" src = "/imagenes5/facebookNikon1.gif" alt = "video about Facebook">

        <p>
          <q>
            One  day, <em> I don't know why </em> [my italics], I started searching on the internet for forums about cameras.
            I searched in English, because I assumed that in Spanish
            I wasn't going to find anything valuable, technically speaking. I found a site called <a class="blue-marker"
               href = "https://www.photo.net"> Photonet </a>, an American page where people talked about a
            bunch of things that I had hardly thought existed: lenses,  sensors,  film, lights, studios. "And they posted
            Photos. And
            I spent the whole weekend looking at photos and reading, just for the pleasure of seeing photos and reading. On Monday, when I was at work, I couldn't stop, it was like addiction to pornography without
              pornography. </strong>
          </q>
        </p>

        <p>
          <q>
            It didn't take more than two weeks to want to move to a new level. I ran away from the office one afternoon;
            sales were going
              Well, the bosses were abroad at a congress; the quiet office environment. 
            I sold my outdated camera and bought a Canon Rebel.

        <p>
          <q>
            I'm not sorry to say that I was afraid to go outside with a Rebel. [Here Roberto narrates widely bad
            experiences
            with security in Bogotá.] (...).  Anyone weekend tried to recover from various
              hectic weeks in the
              job. The company had resolved to change the logo, change the website, and they had also fired
              various 
            middle managers and base personnel. I don't want to talk about that anymore. On Saturday <strong> I realized on another page
            </strong> that I had met in
            Photonet, <a class="blue-marker" href="https://www.dpreview.com"> Dpreview </a>, that the lens my Rebel came with was
            ordinary,
            plastic, not so sharp, as the professional lenses, <a class="blue-marker" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_L_lens"> the
              L </a>, they were much better. That day I went out to take
             photos
            and the camera hit the door. The Lens autofocus no longer worked. On Sunday I was to San
            Andresito and bought an used L lens, for another million and a half.

            (...) I took photos for fun. I don't remember the last time I took out that camera. Maybe it was on the
            my marriage
            sister in law. <strong> My brother-in-law, who is a doctor, took out his Nikon, and insisted that it was faster than
              my Canon. I showed him it didn't, and that also mine
              had higher resolution. </strong>

          <p> Sometimes in content marketing, no one knows who you work for. </p>
          <p> Content marketing is highly effective in Generation X segments, with purchasing power.
          </p>
          <p> But <dfn> what is Content Marketing? Two definitions. One: is to sell without the target being
              realize that they are
              selling; 2) is to sell while entertaining and "educating", <em> offering "quality" content </em>). </dfn> </p>
