                    AN IMPACCABLE GROUP of Hong Kong citizens took a downtown bridge months ago to protest against China. They spend at least 12
                    hours a day exchanging messages on private digital networks that have nothing to do with Twitter or Facebook. That
                    hectic world of "open" social networks has served as a platform to defend their ideas and actions (it also helped me to
                    contact them); However, it is not there where they express their feelings or where it is possible to observe -so to speak- their true social networks: friends, romantic relationships ... wishes. If I want to know why they walk on that
                    bridge wearing adidas shoes, using iPhones and shotting canon cameras, I know what to do: I know that the answer will be less on their
                    "social networks" and more on their "Dark Social"; I know that I can research it without being in Hong Kong and that the
                    key is to approach them with the strategies of a digital Malinowsky; <a class="blue-marker"
                        href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bronislaw-Malinowski">Malinowsky</a> , one of the most important social
                    scientists of the modern 20th century, spent years among "the savages" of Melanesia observing their sexuality and
                    material culture.

                <h2>How did I manage to observe the Dark Social of the Hong Kong students?</h2>

            
                <p>
                    I used my twitter profile, which clearly speaks of a man in his twenties who has been searching for a long time for the
                    causes of youth protests worldwide. In my feed I usually share and publish information, photos, video and data on the
                    economic and political problems that plague my generation, the "Gen Z". These problems have caused the last waves of
                    protest, from Egypt to Chile, passing through Hong Kong (Hong Kong has always aroused my attention, as I am passionate
                    about the history of contemporary China. In that history one constantly finds a counterpoint between the "Maoist"
                    modernization and the traditions of communist political culture: What happens to young women in China and Hong Kong is fascinating and I always have room in my tweets for it.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    As an ethnographer, I know that if you interview these young people without knowing these contexts, you will receive
                    fake answers , well thought out and aloud, but far from <a class="blue-marker"
                        href="/pdfs/110532_Tango_Squads__How_Adidas_used_in.pdf">what a market researcher is looking for.</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    My age helps, of course, as does the fact that on social media I usually communicate in English (80% of Hong Kong
                    university students are "proficient" in this language). Needless to say that all these things have served me well
                    in my field work on the Latin American and European markets.
                </p>

                <h2>Nike, IPhones and Molotov cocktails</h2>

                <p>
                    A contemporary consumer ethnography should inquire about the relationship between consumption and nonconformity. In my
                    digital fieldwork I discovered that young people throwing Molotov cocktails at Hong Kong police wear sports shoes from
                    brands like Nike and Adidas, private communication apps, and hacked smartphones - the most important discovery, however,
                    was that they are aware of this and that they buy and consume in that way because they believe it is the smartest
                    thing to do. The thing about shoes could well be explained with elemental physics ("I need good traction so that my
                    shots reach the target") but also with the semiotics that links "running" with the protest. How is it possible that
                    someone faces up with a political regime leveraged by an economy of maquilas producing goods like Nike shoes? It is
                    possible because <strong>we are not dealing with stupid consumers</strong> (like the 1960s hippies... yeah, take that boomers!).Brands like Nike provide useful
                    things, wrapped with marketing concepts that are not at odds with almost anything that is important to these young
                    people; In addition, <a href="/pdfs/110631_Nike_builds_mobile-messaging_mus.pdf"> they do it in the right
                        channel</a>(which now seems to be the Dark Social).

                </p>

                <p>
                    Hackers in mainland China publish apps to track the police movement. Programming, being a hacker, is "cool". Should
                    brands adopt some "coders" to be influencers of their brands: probably. Mattel has already done so. About 4 years ago
                    sales of<a
                        href="brand-awareness-distroller-bogota.html#barbieProgramando">Barbie dolls fell.</a> .
                    The organization carried out a large-scale ethnographic study that included more than a dozen countries. It was
                    concluded that mothers had good memories of Barbie but did not want their daughters to think that they should be pretty
                    and slim. The solution was not to rethink the "core" of the brand but to "go back to the roots", because
                    originally Barbie had to emphasize that the role of women was not limited to procreating children. That DNA, translated
                    into our times, explains that we are now seeing Barbies "coders" and that sales will recover above 20%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the computers of my Hong Kong friends it is not uncommon to see Github links. There they share "repos" with which
                    they design updates to apps like the ones I mentioned. To fine-tune the political and technological details, they do not
                    even go to WhatsApp (first line of the Dark Social) or Gmail. Instead they share messages in various apps from the black
                    market, which bounce messages using other users' phones (the goal is that the authorities cannot identify the authors).
                    They also use Apple's Airdrop technology, amplified with bluetooth and encryption scripts other than WhatsApp.Western
                    open social media marketing is integrated with an "open source" consumer subculture that takes place in the shadows of
                    "Dark Social" . But which ends up being more decisive in these consumption styles?
                </p>



                <h2>The political theater of contemporary marketing        </h2>

                <p>
                    In Hong Kong, college students buy computers with solid disks, IPhones, and the latest Google phones. With their
                    computers they create programs to hack those phones and spread "homebrews" (patches that allow the installation of
                    prohibited content in operating systems). These young people - mostly from Gen Z - buy technology to re-enter themselves into the
                    political system (their heroes will not be influencers but incluencers). China responds by forcing the Apple store to
                    ban the app that detects police movements in real time: <strong>these new consumer scenarios appear to consist of a "civil" side
                        of non-conforming brands and citizens</strong> and authoritarian states (who do business with those brands).
                </p>



                <h2>Tune in to the consumer: their needs are the true "needs of the market"</h2>

                <p>
                    "Be sensitive to your clients' difficulties," says <strong>David Reibstein, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School</strong> of
                    the University of Pennsylvania. "If you identify with them, they will be more likely to identify with you." Example: In
                    2009, during the last Great Recession, Hyundai Motor America introduced a new "Warranty" program that allowed new car
                    buyers and tenants to get a novel warranty. The company would buy back your vehicle for up to a year after the original
                    purchase, paying a maximum of $ 7,500 of the depreciation cost,<strong>if the client lost his job in that period.</strong> Customers could
                    also ask the company to take over their car payments for 90 days while they were looking for work - without demanding a
                    refund. The ad included television commercials and online ads with headlines like "We stand behind you for a full year"
                    and "Warranty: certainty in uncertain times." The result? <strong>Hyundai outperformed other automakers </strong> in February 2009. This
                    campaign "set them apart as a company that put customers first, above profit," Reibstein said. As the economy started to
                    recover in 2011, the program was gradually withdrawn.

                    Consumer Z expects from brands a kind of more or less peaceful revolution, very green and very hack <strong> The Millenial
                        expects good prices and changing styles;</strong> the X dreamed of marks within reach of many pockets; Babyboomers wanted
                    innovative brands that produced a much larger variety of products (the same trinkets that the Z want to take from the
                    beaches and the stomachs of the whales).

                    I think Malinowsky would have been a good Gen Z ethnographer: he would have camped with the "digital nomads" in the
                    countryside or on the rivers to understand that ambivalent relationship between consumption and political nonconformity.

                    A reasonable conclusion is that <strong>brands must combine social and digital empathy with a deep interpretation of customer</strong>
                    behavior: this implies adapting to a hyper-politicized consumer situation.When money is tight, consumers tend to make
                    certain predictable changes in their buying habits, for example they eat less. For food companies, that requires
                    promotions and campaigns that not only take advantage of these behavior patterns, but do so in solidarity. Another
                    example: During the Great Recession of 2008, Kraft published more recipes with Kraft products on its website and on
                    social media. In a recession, people have less money and more fear: brands can help ease that anxiety; Psychology has
                    found that a simple way to do this is to build a sense of control based on situational awareness (just as Kraft did,
                    using recipes as useful knowledge for households with cut budgets).
