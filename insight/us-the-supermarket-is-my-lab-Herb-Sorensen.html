                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>
                    Despite the irruption of apps to buy food, traditional retail is still as important as <a class="blue-marker"
                        href="/pdfs/121113_Whats_working_in_supermarkets_an.pdf">ever</a>. The reason: even with corona virus People continue to go to supermarkets
                    to contemplate, touch, analyze, filter and buy.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>The physical relationship with the product - and the act of visiting that ordinary and orderly place that is the
                    supermarket - has not been replaced (but complemented) by technology.</strong>A monumental place that is both
                ordinary and organized, a kind of perfect matrix, produces confidence and relaxation (update: well, not anymore with virus running here and there). It is true that one can always
                observe some obfuscated person in the row of the supermarket, but it is more frequent to observe entire families
                strolling like they were in a picnic, with their little ones on their shoulders, and old women reading magazines, while the endless
                lines of a promotion day take them to cash register.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Supermarkets are not dead or undead. Herb Sorensen - one of the world's experts on the subject - delves into them as a
                    caver. He wears glasses with smart cameras, digital collection devices and software designed by his company: he uses
                    technology to <strong>explore a business that is far from being defeated by technology</strong>. His projects with
                    Unilever and P&G are legendary and his conclusions about retail were wise. In this article we will discuss some tips based
                    on your experience as a market researcher.
                </p>

                <h2>Herb Sorensen: forerunner of retail insights</h2>

                <p>
                    It is more likely that in his student years Herb Sorensen imagined himself working with laboratory rats than with
                    people. Today, however, he is a retail guru. Matt Ohligschlager - one of the marketing heads at Procter & Gamble - said
                    of him that his books were essential to understand why people do what they do when they are shopping; <dfn>Franz A. Dill -
                    co-founder of the same brand --- was more accurate in explaining that Sorensen's work had attempted to solve an old
                    market research problem, namely <strong>how to measure the less obvious aspects of the relationship between shoppers and supermarket shelves.</strong></dfn>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Few would imagine that behind classics like The Science of Retailing was a doctor of biochemistry. What did biology and
                    chemistry have to do with the behavior of people who went to, say, Walmart, to buy sausages and milk? The answer is
                    probably in Sorensen's circle of friends. Put simply: <strong>When your friends are P&G managers and you're some kind of Indiana
                        Jones from supermarkets, it 's more or less easy to get invited to work for P&G.</strong> Put in a not so simple way, the story
                    is as follows.

                <p>
                    In 1970 Sorensen obtained a Ph.D in Biochemistry. Instead of being employed in a company, he created a small laboratory
                    to provide services related to food quality; <strong>He eventually noticed that supermarkets needed to investigate how consumers
                        felt about the taste and texture of food</strong>. In other words, he discovered that in retail it was necessary to "test" the
                    products, and, as expert in chemistry and biology, he could have a deep perspective on the characteristics that
                    produced the taste, smell and appearance of food.
                </p>



                <h2>Bob Stevens, Sorensen's mentor</h2>

                <p>
                    For 40 years, Bob Stevens led consumer research at P&G. From some autobiographical comments, we know that Sorensen
                    learned from him things like the following:
                </p>


                <div class="bannerTwitero">
                        <h2>2 Tips to predict the behavior of the buyer in the supermarket</h2>
                        <p>Bob Stevens was a kind of precursor to predictive models. Curiously, his techniques had a lot of amateur ethnography.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Bob handed out coupons in supermarkets. For each coupon he asked for the phone number of the favored one. He called a
                                few weeks later to find out if this person had returned to consume the gift. The characteristics of the interviewee
                                would therefore help to determine predictors of recurrent consumption.
                            </li>
                            <li>Bob followed consumers to their homes. Sometimes, he would suggest that they let him see what exactly they did with
                                the products he had previously taken from the supermarket shelves.</li>  
                            </ol>

                <h2>Third tip: study the consumer in their natural environment
                </h2>
                    <p>
                        Are humans complex rats? Already an experienced market researcher, Sorensen said he was inspired by Stevens to come up
                        with the following premise:
                    </p>

                <q>
                <dfn> We - Sorensen says - believe that the consumer should be studying in their natural environment. This means
                    researching supermarket buyers in supermarkets; food consumers in restaurants, students in schools, cooks in their
                    kitchens, etc.</dfn>

                </q>
                
                <p>
                    <dfn>Why? This process allows "testing in context": instead of observing people like laboratory rats, they are observed
                        as they consume what they actually consume .</dfn>
                </p>
                <p>I think the above would also be true for the rats themselves: to test our products with rats we go to the laboratory,
                    to understand what rats need and are looking for we go to the sewer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remi, the rat that starred in <a class="blue-marker" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_(film)">Ratatouille</a>, said that food
                    always comes for the one who loves cooking. If we follow Sorensen, we would say that insights always come for those who
                    are passionate about understanding meat and bone consumers.
                </p>

                <h2>Fourth Tip: look for alliances</h2>

                <p>
                    More than a tip on retail in supermarkets, this is a tip on how someone can make money and prestige by analyzing retail
                    in supermarkets.

              <h2>Fifth Tip: supermarkets should not focus on traffic but on customers</h2>
              <p>
                When you are standing in a supermarket, analyzing consumption and trying to figure out what the sales opportunities are,
                it is not easy to decide what to focus on.
              </p>
              <p>
                What is the difference between focusing on traffic and focusing on the consumer? <dfn>When a marketing director is focused on
                    traffic, he is more concerned with the spatial distribution of merchandise on the premises, as he seeks order and space
                    to walk, as if they were ends in themselves. When a marketing director is focused on consumers, <strong>she wants the store
                        organization to make the consumer spend as much as possible on her family basket,</strong></dfn> even if it means a bit of "mess"
                (some use the shelves as barricades ... .And sell more!).
              </p>
