        <p><em><span style="color: rgb(248, 156, 8);">In this article ❧ </span>Distroller - the Mexican toy brand - has arrived in
            Colombia. Its main strength is the attraction that many Colombians
            feel for Mexican culture. But that is also its main weakness: What would happen if distroller fails to sufficiently
            translate the cultural codes on which its products are based?</em></p>

        <div class="publicidadEnArticulo" id="oculto_publicidadEnArticulo">
        </div>
        <script src="/js/us-publicidadEnArticulo.js"></script>


        <div class="popup" onclick="myFunction()">
          <p class="highlight">¿ <strong>Brands</strong> analyzed?</p>
          <span class="popuptext" id="myPopup">Mattel, Distroller, "México"</span>
        </div>

        <h2 id="marca">Mexico as brand</h2>

        <p>Mexico is a brand, and this is an asset to any other Mexican brand that wants to position itself abroad. This applies
          even
          to the United States, a market that includes some xenophobia (and an ambivalent attraction for) as an spicy obstacle;
          and it applies to Colombia, a country where it is
          not difficult to find various manifestations of this taste for "the Mexican."</p>

        <p>
          If one had to choose one of the causes of Mexico's success as a brand in Colombia, the influence of television might be
          chosen. The most obvious example is El chavo and Televisa's novels, which have been voraciously watched since the 1980s.
          Nowadays, El chavo is still part of the channels programming on some television channels and is almost as important as
          Acapulco Shore.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a second cause had to be identified (business decisions must have sufficient knowledge of the context) this would be
          Mexican tourism marketing. <strong>Mexico has been able to sell itself as an exotic and magical destination:</strong>
          pyramids, food and
          the style of La Rioja have been fundamental parts of it. In the case of Colombia, we should add the Mariachi - which
          seems to be used more in Bogotá than in Mexico City.
        </p>

        <p id="propuesta">Enough context to take for granted the decision to bring Distroller to Colombia. </p>


        <div class="bannerTwitero">
          <h2>Insight</h2>
          <q>Distroller : "Mexico" is a brand, and is an asset for any Mexican brand that wants to position itself abroad. The
            only difficulty - and it is not complicated to overcome it - is to properly translate the cultural codes on which
            Mexican marketing outside Mexico is based. </q>


        </div>

        <h2>Distroller Value Proposition</h2>
        <p>
          <dfn>Distroller is a toy brand - for girls (and kul boys?). The value proposition is to provide an unrealistic,
            <strong>fantastic experience of the classic line of dolls that simulate motherhood,</strong> with dresses, accessories
            and others.</dfn>
        </p>
        <p>Now, Distroller plays with the following specific value propositions: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>"Design 102 percent Mexican": it works, among other things, because Mexican painting and crafts (including the
            <strong><a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_mexicano" style="color: deeppink"> the famous Mexican rose
              </a></strong> ) enjoy perceived quality (Aaker) and even brand loyalty in cities like New York.</li>
          <li>"Distroller does not educate, he only gives his humble opinion." This is intelligent in a cultural context in which
            passionate positions and emotional overflows are common, from high politics to the anonymity of social networks.
            Distroller, on the other hand, does not sell correct ideas , rather it makes money with subtle social criticism. Later
            we continue with this point.</li>
          <li>Freedom, creativity vindication of diversity: <strong>Distroller's products are explicitly aimed at girls of diverse
              ethnic backgrounds,</strong> who are part of various types of families. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="retos">Challenges the brand faces
        </h2>

        <p>
          The segment of toys for girls is much more dynamic than that of boys (for better and for worse). This is because
          cultural representations about femininity and childhood are in a severe process of mutation. Let's see:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ideas about <strong>motherhood</strong> are increasingly ambiguous and demanding.</li>
          <li>The rising educational levels in the female population have created a more picky demand in the middle classes.</li>
          <li>The impact of <strong>feminist discourse</strong> (of which brands like Mattel have been appropriated).</li>
          <li>Lost of value on the shelves of the stores (it is increasingly common to see greater discounts on the toy lines "for
            girls"</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 id="infoEsta">Statistical information</h2>

        <p>
          In this section we analyze 1) statistics of the Netquest online panel for Colombia on toy consumption and cultural
          representations in strata 3, 4 and 5, and 2) statistics based on own quantitative collection applied in some Pepe Ganga
          stores in Bogotá in Bogotá . To access the rest of the statistical information click
        </p>


        <h2 id="enfoque">Online focus group </h2>

        <p>
          We work with two couples, one in Mexico City and one in Bogotá. The first is an aunt and her niece, loyal Distroller
          fans in Mexico; the second a father and his daughter, possible fans of the brand in Colombia.


        </p>

        <q style="margin-top: 2rem;"> "Yes I like it but I don't understand the names [Interviewer: For example?] Why do they say
          backpacks to suitcases [referring to products like" Backpacks "and" Ksimeritos "]
        </q>
        <p> María, 31, domestic partership, a daughter, accountant, homeowner, middle class, Mexico City, participant of an online
          focus group on Distroller .</p>


        <h2>Consumption profiles studied </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Mexico City: aunt who periodically gives Distroller products to her niece (5 years, thin, curly hair , brunette ,
            goes to kindergarten [at the beginning it cost a little, but has become a kind of leader among companions], she likes
            being independent, "feminine" [likes to comb and comb dolls], has many toys, only daughter,
            middle class, professional parents with expertise.)</li>
          <li>Bogotá: father who is not sure to give Distroller dolls to his daughter [5 years, light brown hair, thin,
            "introverted",
            likes dolls and carts very much, is a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_McStuffins">Doc
              McStuffins</a>, and plays everything he has to watch carefully: to be a
            doctor, veterinarian, mom, etc.]</li>
        </ul>

          housing stratum 4 Bogotá, has unfinished postgraduate studies.</p>

        <h2>Design evolution</h2>

        <p>The fundamental change is in the expressiveness of the design. In 2009 Chamoy had hypnotic pupils, no movement, and
          too elementary eyelashes. The hair solution was smart (lines like curls) but not glamorous. The makeup was flat (for
          example on the cheeks), while the accessory on the forehead ("balaca") received more attention.
        </p>

        <p>In 2019 we have the same solution: a drawing with a large head (standard of children's drawing), the same colors, the
          same accessories. But at the same time we have something new: a character that projects emotions, which in 2009 did
          not happen. He does it with hands (in 2009 hidden), eyes, mouth and leg movement (see Image 1) . </p>

          <p>
            Distroller : One of the fundamental changes in the brand image is the expressiveness in the design (another, no doubt,
            is the diversity in the product portfolio). That strategy has created value for the brand. On the other hand, one of
            the
            great challenges is to <strong>translate some of the cultural codes, </strong> successfully used in Mexico and Spain,
            to not depend
            exclusively on the popularity of Mexican folklore abroad.

        <p>
          Distroller projects "good ondez". He does it consciously. Aware that it is not the same to position a brand today than
          59 years ago, when Barbie was born (the first Barbie was marketed in 1959). <dfn>The barbies projected beauty, a white,
            thin, green-eyed, suburbial beauty, which operated in a market ruled by racist and traditional values ​​(the family
            based on the provider husband, was one of the main norms). Nowadays, the market demands things like good education and
            politeness.</dfn>
          Distroller's good spirit is expressed in his language, full of invented words (virgencita plis, mexican pagüer, amiguis
          foreber), taken from the Latino speech ; or at least the representation of them that has the Distroller marketing.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, Distroller's distribution channels have changed, or, rather, have expanded. Before the brand distributed in
          its Mexican stores, but now distributes in several South American countries, Spain and the United States. However,
          <strong>Distroller persists in the same language codes,</strong> relying exclusively on the Mexican charism of the
          brand.
        </p>

        <p>
          What if a Colombia or Spanish, buyer cannot even pronounce -even understand- the word "Neonatitlan"? What would
          happen if it is not understood that these are multiple allusions at the same time (Tenochtitlan, capital of the Aztec
          empire + neonates + sarcasm-marketing)? What if the names of the characters are confused with words that buyers in
          Colombia associate with other things (stuff that would be called “albur” in Mexico)? How do buyers receive
          Distroller's Mexican branding, compared to Mattel's Mexican branding? (see image 4) What do they think of their prices?

        <h2>5 Tips for Distroller Designers and Marketers </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Take a look at the Barbie programmer and download her app and games (see Image 5). How about a programmable Ksi
            Merito, or a virtual pet?</li>
          <li>Perhaps it's needed a review of the price in Colombia. Unlike Mexican boutiques, Pepe Ganga will have
            many options that can be interchangeable for more than one buyer.</li>

        <h2>¡¡¡¡¡¡¡BONUS!!!!!!</h2>

        <p>
          Although the video was deleted from YouTube - after obtaining more than 3 million views - here is the link of the
          Merca2.0 article, which discusses the <a
             href="https://www.merca20.com/perturbador-video-ksi-merito-la-marca-distroller/">controversy</a> by a Distroller
          commercial . We disagree with the owner of Merca2.0,
          who uses the word "pertubardor", to refer to the video. Another interpretation could be that the brand adjusts - in a
          somewhat sarcastic way - to the tastes that still predominate in the Latin market: this is suggested by the popularity
          of the brand in stores, even in Spain (where it is distributed in El Corte Inglés).
        </p>

        <p>
          In a more recent video we observe the same pattern: a brand using contemporary codes of mass communication to stage a
          product that is both innovative and traditional. Judge it yourself in the following video, in which we have a kind of
          neo-reality of scientific girls who learn to be moms (or, at least, to love Distroller).
