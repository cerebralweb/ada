      <p>
        Women under 36 are increasingly focused on a pursuit of well-being. If they have a university degree and an ongoing
        professional career they are even more specific about their priorities. Those in this segment - at least many of them -
        want to be mothers and want to continue their professional careers. <strong>They want companies to adapt to them, but at the
          same time they want to fit into the companies.</strong> This feeling, apparently unmanageable, is perfectly understandable in the
        context of a recent research developed by Hexis. Ethnographic and qualitative techniques have been especially
        useful, since they have allowed us to go deep in the ambivalent feelings of millennials who want to be doubly successful (in
        the company and at home). Quantitatively, we have discovered that 90% of this segment want to breastfeed their baby
        instead of using infant formula, and that 60% have often experienced feelings of guilt (associated with obstacles to
        breastfeeding, such as meetings, termination of maternity leave and work under pressure).
      </p>

      <p>
        These conclusions are derived from some B2B research. Hexis decided to develop its own project to validate what was
        found autonomously. The methodology was to develop a holistic study (quantitatively and qualitatively) of an open and
        permanent online community.

        <h2 >B2B research: essential in large companies
        </h2>
        <p>
          <dfn>
            In market research this modality (Business To Business, for its acronym in English) can be defined as the
          hiring of an agency to build insights about another company, for example, about their work culture. Although it usually
          occupies less space in the agencies' portfolio - compared to B2C (Business to Costumer) services - B2B research is more
          common than previously thought, and is becoming increasingly important due to the increasing complexity of Organizations
          and labor markets.

      <h2>La Leche League: a permanent online community on Facebook</h2>

      <p>
        La Leche League is a Facebook community formed to promote breastfeeding worldwide. stro
        It has 24,748 members - who only
        enter on recommendation - and their language is Spanish. The League has established important institutional alliances
        with global organizations such as <a
        href="https://unicef.org.co/donaciones/donar?utm_source=google&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=marca-unicef&gclid=Cj0KCQjwsvrpBRCsARIsAKBR_0Jt9DwqfKK3rdmKyVJLt4yjhPdJEApBKaObVPSN8ETQdvRP6MW41L8aAqAPEALw_wcB">UNICEF</a> . Judging by the traffic, the quality of the conversations and the rigor of its
        moderators, it is clear that the League has had a big impact. Its influence can be verified in the fact that thousands of mothers
        put into practice the techniques and knowledge that the League provides about breastfeeding.
      </p>

        <h2> 10 trends of successful mothers under 39
        </h2>

      <li>They are promoting breastfeeding on social networks.      </li>
      <li>They hope to vote for politicians that take action on the matter</li>
      <li>They support the opening of nursing rooms in companies</li>
      <li>They buy self-help and coaching books to understand their status as # successful # mothers.  </li>
      <li>They are more likely to diets and try a healthy lifestyle.</li>
      <li>Increase your productivity without waiting for additional economic incentives</li>
      <li>They want to use remote work technologies such as streaming and digital boards</li>
      <li>They buy toys that stimulate decision making in their babies</li>
      <li>They are not overprotective with their children</li>
      <li>Welcome the products that use feminist marketing</li>    
     
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>One of the central characteristics of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/lllespanol/?ref=bookmarks">la
        Liga de la Leche</a> is its reluctance to any form of marketing in the community</strong>. The moderators (who
      must be accredited with precise standards to reach that position) do not allow brands or products to be mentioned, post
      photos or marketing videos, or conversations lead to recommending specific purchases of nursing accessories, Formula
      milks , baby clothes, etc. In other words, <strong>the League does not allow marketing </strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The League is organized as a confederation or network of followers, grouped by cities clusters. In Bogotá, the League meetings
      take place at the Country Clinic . There we met several women influenced by this organization. Going to that place was
      important for the project, as it would <strong>allow us to combine offline activities with the netnography</strong> of the online
      community .
    </p>
    <p>
      The following transcript partially includes an in-depth interview with one of five participants from a focus group. This
      mathematician - with a doctorate in finance - worked for 3 years in a foreign bank well known in Colombia .
      After having his baby, and returning to work, he decided to change; and in part this was due to the influence of the
      Milk League.

    <h2>Work under pressure, guilt and change
    </h2>

    <p>
     <q>
      One morning I received a video on my Whatsapp. It was my baby waking up, smiling, crying and being cradled by my
      mother-in-law. When he started crying, they edited the video, so I wouldn't feel bad. I watched the video a couple of
      times while I was at a working breakfast with my team. We discussed ... things. Have you never had the feeling of
      discussing things that do not need to be discussed? <strong>[my interviewee did not look at me while asking. I let her go on.]</strong>
      It didn't happen to me at first, everything surprised me. But, since I got married, and I had a daughter, I began to
      have that feeling of being in the wrong place; At least sometimes, like that morning.
     </q>

    </p>     
    <p>
      <q>     And I felt bad. I had asked my husband to send them to me (the videos). I thought they could cheer me up; but no. (...) 
        </q>
    </p>
    <p>
      <q>
        I said to myself: who knows, with the videos I can remember what my baby was like in the morning. Sad but true:
        what happened is that my tears were leaking, there, in front of my colleagues.
      </q>
    </p>

    <img class="responsiveImageComGif" src="/imagenes5/facebookLigaDeLaLeche7.gif"  class="responsiveImage" alt="facebook image">

    <p>
      <q>
        I am math gal; I like numbers; Since I was a girl. In high school I won a mathematical olympiad. In the Andes I came to know
        business. I don't really come from a wealthy family, as you might think. When I entered that university, the tuition
        fees were more payable; My parents didn't have to borrow much. When there was that strong rise I was
        already leaving that place. But it was there where I decided to be an entrepreneur. I took an elective course at the Faculty of
        Management, and I saw myself doing an MBA in finance, in the United States. Most important: <strong>I never dared to start a
          company.Instead I started working in banking. I earned well. </strong> I remember looking forward and dreaming to be
        promoted; and I succeeded.

      </q>
    </p>
 

    <p>
   <q>
    I got married, and there were things that start to change in me. <strong>They offered me the possibility of running a new bank
      office in Panama, and I did not accept.</strong> In that company one entered in the office at 8 in the morning and did not know
    at which time you come back home; They paid well (with that I paid an apartment), but one had to perfor at 200 percent, literally, without
    exaggeration. A friend made a joke once. She said that if she left the office and there was sun light, she felt guilty. What would it be
    like to run an office in another country?

   </q>
    </p>

    <p>
      <q>
        When the baby was born I had a few months of maternity licence, like any citizen. It was hard for me to establish
        breastfeeding. I thought it was because of my age (I gave birth at 38). But no. The problem was anguish, fear. In the
        Milk League I learned that I wasn't the only one. In many moms I saw the same thing: the anguish that [the Milk] was not
        enough, that the extraction <strong>[refers to the use of extractors to leave Milk stored] </strong> will not work. And the fear of what
        they will say; that normally it was nothing other than the criticisms of the relatives; fortunately it was not my case.
        Society is hard upon breastfeeding: The breasts in a Victoria Secret advertisement are erotic and sell, but breastfeeding
        breasts are still offensive to many people .

     <q>
      I didn't imagine breastfeeding at work, or in the car. And in a bank you will not see a nursing room; but it wouldn't help, 
      if you take into account that you leave all day, that stress and lack of direct breastfeeding
      decrease production, and that milk does last up to 12 hours. Yes, a nursing room is just a palliative.
     </q>
    </p>
    <p>
     <q>
      I began to fear that Claudia would happen to me. She was a co-worker totally dedicated to the company. He had an eight
      year old daughter. When he saw that I was pregnant, he opened her private life to me, as if I were his confidant; although I didn't tell her
      anything important. She told me that her daughter hated her, that she sometimes told her even the worst things you can imagine, that she had had to
      feed her with baby formula, and that the worst was at two years old, when she started yelling at her that she was a witch and
      that she didn't love her; I remember seeing her - in the middle of the same breakfasts and lunches - reading Whatsapp messages
      and crying; Would it be her husband, or her daughter? I don't know. He also told me that he wanted to breastfeed, but
      that any change was impossible because they had a loan. I knew that when her daughter was born, the company didn't even
      have a nursing room, and that extractions would have been frowned upon; as there was no such culture there.
     </q>
    </p>
    <p>
     <q>
      I went to work for three weeks and quit. <strong>I turned my professional life into something really new</strong>. I stopped thinking of money as the
      number one priority. I started working as a freelancer and today I have a coaching blog (...).
