                <p> Sony PS4 and Microsoft XBOX marketing on
                  Latin America is not particularly ambitious. That was what I was thinking while looking at my old 
                  Xbox casting
                  smoke: the dreaded ring of death. While looking at
                  Amazon for a replacement I asked myself "why The marketing of Sony PS4 and Microsoft XBOX in
                  Latin America is not particularly ambitious? And why am I going to buy an Xbox? I answered with enthusiasm
                  the first one: "Because the market is not big enough." I got distracted by a special edition of Gears
                  of War. Finally I amended:
                  "The marketing of Sony PS4 and Microsoft XBOX in Latin America is not particularly ambitious, and great, yet."
                </p>


        <img itemtype="image" src="/imagenes5/xbox.gif" alt="Ilustración de un mando de Sony PS4"
          class="responsiveImage">

          <p> Answering the second question was inconvenient: I would have ended up imagining that my new Xbox was exploding, or
            
            transformed into a cyborg. I hadn't finished understanding the scene (a burning Xbox one) when I was already
            staring at the
            a message thanking me for my purchase and informing that I had upgraded.
            
            <p> The following Monday I met with Paulo and Carmen and I gave them  following Insight </p>

         

            <p> - Which entrepreneur doesn't care about brand loyalty? I asked them, while holding a book of
              <a class="blue-marker" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Aaker"> David Aaker </a> -.
              Sony and Microsoft - I went on - have fought a battle
              pitched by consumer sentiment for consoles and video games, a battle that has largely been
              delivered on the
              Internet. <strong> Sony's strategy is to seduce with an
                <em> all in one </em> </strong>, XBOX's strategy is to build loyalty around a community of gamers on the
              <em> American </em> style, with graphics power.
              <p> - The word "loyalize" does not exist, - Carmen mumbled. </p>
              <p> - PS4 bets on flooding the region with advertising --I ignored the correction attempt--, a
                advertising that says "this is the console that has it all:
                graphics, unforgettable games, price ". XBOX, on the other hand, has a localized strategy in countries like
                Mexico,
                around franchises like Gears of War and online gaming. </p>

                <p> Paulo nodded. But added: </p>
                <p> - Wait: why do you say Xbox bets on <a class="blue-marker"
                     href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2018/02/05/the-nintendo-switchs-secret-is-that-its-already-obsolete/#2c261bae3913">
                    a minimum of graphics power </a>? As far as I know, that's Nintendo's strategy. </p>
                <p> - It's true, - I replied. But it is only part of the truth. Sony and Xbox have opted for consoles with high technology,whose
                  price they have in fact constantly subsidized, hoping to stay alive in the war of consoles and to collect profits with the sale
                  of games.Nintendo instead offers consoles with less technology to recover their production cost int he sale; just one precision:
                  at least in recent generations of Sony consoles it has almost always been one step ahead Microsoft, technologically speaking;
                  for example, when the first Xbox arrived, Sony was already on the PS2. -- Apart from the history of PC gaming, which was born in
                  the 1980s-- Paulo added. </p>
                <p> Aside, 'I agreed. The question, if anything, is <strong> How does the PS4 and Xbox Brand Loyalty works in Latin America?
                  </strong> --I concluded-- </p>


                  <p> The result of the editorial meeting was predictable: we would do a small study on the subject and would write an Insight. The
                    goal would be to get closer to the experience of Xbox and PS4 fans. </p>
                  <p> Whether to investigate a classic retail problem (the sale of, say, a sauce in a supermarket) you cross sales data with
                    qualitative information, how to investigate a digital retail problem? Let's see: when talking about PS4 and Xbox we are talking
                    about selling video games (and consoles), that is, a kind of digital retail. Ok, so how do you analyze this relatively new form
                    of retail? </p>
                  <p> The solution provided by our research team was divided into three areas. </p>
                  <h2> Steps of the investigation </h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Clarify what part of this complex problem we refer to as videogames we were going to address in the insight.</li>
                    <li> Determine why brand loyalty is important in the video game market in Latin America. </li>
                    <li> Combine quantitative data with qualitative field work. </li>
                  </ul>


            <img itemtype="image" src="/imagenes5/xbox-mando-xbox-mexico.jpg" alt="Mando de xbox one."
              class="responsiveImage">
            <figcaption>Illustration by Carmen Zavala</figcaption>

            <p> Accordingly, the following plan was drawn up. </p>
            <h2 id="loyalty"> How to achieve brand loyalty? </h2>
            <p> Brand value is constituted by what ordinary people add to the value that they get in a purchase. A neighbor buys a bottle of
              water: the value acquired is to quench their thirst with the content of the bottle; the brand value is that, added to other
              things that do not have to do with quenching your thirst but with the consumer's perception of the brand (continuing with the
              example: that the bottle is"ecological", that the brand is recognized, etc.). </p>
            <ul> Understood in this way, the brand value consists of:<li> Brand awareness. </li>
              <li> BRAND LOYALTY </li>
              <li> Associations that arouses the brand in the consumer's mind. </li>
              <li> Perceived quality of the product </li>
            </ul>

            <p> We are interested in the second one here. <strong> Very loyal consumers can guarantee -to some extent- predictable Profits:
                they are counted on even in the worst moments. </strong> In the video game market a good example arises from the Wii U, a
              console that barely sold about 18 million units, mostly bought by old Wii and Game Cube users. It was a bad investment for them,
              because the games library was poor; however, further evidence of the tremendous loyalty of Nintendo fans is that the price of
              the same console in the used market has exploded in recent months, as it seems to be turning into a collection object. </p>
            <p> Retaining loyal customers is less expensive than searching for new customers: another simple truth about of brand loyalty.
            </p>
            <p> Now, <strong> How to achieve brand loyalty? </strong> Creating identity around the brand. OR, in other words, that the product
              is associated with certain lifestyles. And for this, we must understand the lifestyles of the consumers that you want to <span
                    id="insight"> reach </span>. </p>

                    <div class="bannerTwitero">
                      <h2> Insight </h2> Xbox: There are customers moving away from the brand for some practices of monetization. According to our
                      study, brand loyalty towards Sony PS4 was achieved when the saw in the mark traits of his character, like rebellion and desire
                      for freedom. The switch from Xbox to PS4 occurred when the user associated Xbox with the opposite: obligation (updates and
                      subscription) and the imposition of advertising (despite having paid for the console and having an Xbox Live subscription).

          <h2 id="teens"> Teen Segment </h2>
          <p> <strong> One of the problems when analyzing brand loyalty is the perceived quality </strong>. Briefly: to create brand loyalty
            you have to understand what quality means for the segment or segments to which you sell the product. As we will see in the case
            study, perception may differ from actual quality. </p>
          <p> What are the central segments here? One of them is, without a doubt, the teenagers: they use video games, and they are more
            likely to identify with gadgets. So the question would be how that segment determines how much quality is there in a video game
            platform </p>
          <p> The relationship between lifestyle and brand loyalty is reflected in the following case, researched since the netnography
            perspective. </p>

            <h2 id="netnografia"> Netnography on the conversion of an Xbox fan into a PS4 fan </h2>
            <p> The netnographic work was divided into two tasks: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Check out the streaming portal <a class="blue-marker" href="https://www.twitch.tv"> Twitch </a>. </li>
              <li> Contact fans. </li>
              <li> Interview a fan on skype. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Netnography on Twitch</h2>
            <p> Twitch is the main video game streaming portal worldwide. Users from all over the world broadcast their games and they are
              watched by their own fans and subscribers. In the portal there are tribes of gaming: by titles, by franchises and also by
              console brands. Behind the scenes is Amazon(interested in selling hardware using the site as an advertising platform) and video
              game studios (which sponsor streamers to foster a culture where the gamer is a cultural hero). We observed the portal for
              several days, putting up special attention in the Latino community (increasingly active there). We contacted five candidates
              (four men and a woman); only two of them agreed to be interviewed, but we opted for one, because he showed interest in being
              interviewed. </p>

          <h2> Xbox experience </h2>
          <p> "Play Station 'manda la parada' ," said Pablo in Colombian slang. He is a 15 years old young man, the son of a plastic surgeon
            and a cookbook writer --an upper middle class gamer. Twitch Pablo's account is full of allusions to his adoration for Sony. The
            emoticons he uses are based on characters from the best-known franchises (Sly Cooper, Nathan Drake, Kratos), <strong> their
              archivings videos always contains in the footer a mention to the Play Station Network community </strong>-- which includes the
            Sony logo --and in its Bio the games list consists of 11 titles from Sony and three from Nintendo; there is also a list of used
            accessories for his streaming, and each item is linked to a link that leads to an Amazon offer (the link of your Ps4, for
            example, goes to an Amazon offer of on sale consoles). </p>
          <p> However, Pablo did not start with Sony. His first videogame was Gears of War 1, the most successful Xbox game. "The console
            was programmed [pirated]," Pablo said."It wasn't mine, it was my uncle's ****** console. What I liked about Gears was that it
            had a very fun gameplay, it was fluid, but not overly difficult. Soon after I tried many <a class="blue-marker"
               href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade"> arcade games </a>, and I realized that the Gears charm was that looked like a <a
               class="blue-marker" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7vcUei5u2E"> Contra </a> in third dimension (...)The most cool was
            that the characters were fighting with a giant aliens, but at the same time they were somewhat funny: it was like watching a
            cartoon that you know is violent but it really isn't scary. When I started to dedicating many hours at day to play my dad
            scolded at me and told me that it was going to get worse on math and stuff. So, playing Xbox became like a form of rebellion.
            When they announced the Xbox One I got a job on vacation to buy it (my dad had cut off the revenue for games; he said 'Carachas,
            this carajito now I know he was wasting his time again', and things like that) (...) <strong> When I could buy the console the
              experience was bad </strong>. Whenever the console was asking for updates, and if I didn't do it I couldn't play anything, not
            even an offline campaign, and when the download was finally finished, the console desktop was full of ads, as if one wouldn't
            have paid for the console. Another issue I didn't like was that it forced me to open Facebook and talk about my games in, but it
            turned out that I hated Facebook (...). Finally, it was obligatory to pay subscription if one wanted to play online. I sold it
            in San Andresito "</p>
