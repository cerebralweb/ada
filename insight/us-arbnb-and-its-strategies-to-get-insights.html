                <h2>The Airbnb Insights Machine</h2>
                <p> Judd Antin - director of research for the brand - is in charge of the
                    interesting task of converting shopping experiences into actionable insights for
                    Airbab. Antin works with 57 experts who combine large sets of quantitative
                    information with qualitative information. <strong>The strategic goal of insights
                        is to "deeply understand our global guests and hosts well enough to make
                        decisions"</strong>, Antin said at the 2017 Strategy Festival of <a class="blue-marker"
                       href="https://www.aaaa.org/">the American Association of
                        Advertising Agencies.</a> In his presentation, Antin talked about two
                    projects that demonstrate how his Insights Department helps the company. </p>
                <h2>Judd Antin</h2>
                <p> Judd Antin is itself an interesting topic. On reading his <a class="class3"
                       href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juddantin/">linkedin</a>, his scientific
                    training is obvious: he completed a doctorate in information systems and studied
                    psychology and anthropology; The latter is his basic training. At the bottom of
                    its LinkedIn page there are several recommendations (this tool serves to display
                    what other members of the platform would say about you). </p>
                <p> Elizabeth Chuchill - Director of UX Research at Google - posted the following
                    about Antin: </p>
                <q> Judd and I have worked together in various capacities–he was my intern at Yahoo!
                    Research, we collaborated informally, and <strong>on completion of his
                        PhD,</strong> he joined my group, the Internet Experiences Group in Yahoo!
                    Research. Judd is an amazingly talented researcher. He is deeply knowledgeable
                    about his chosen areas of research and he's a gifted lateral thinker who can
                    make connections and think creatively to solve problems. In addition to be an
                    ideas person, he can execute to put theory into practice. He has the discipline
                    to work rigorously toward grounded results and is willing to roll his sleeves up
                    and get the everyday mundane work of moving from ideas to results. This make him
                    the model applied scientist, able to have both short and long term impact in
                    both academic and business contexts. </q>
                <p> The Airbab Research Department is divided into three wings. Survey Science ,
                    obviously related to insight extraction from large data sets; <strong>User
                        Experience (UX),</strong> which investigates the human computer relationship
                    with digital ethnography techniques and Product Specialists who are dedicated to
                    translating insights into specific strategies and solutions. </p>
                <ul>
                    <hr>Some awesome facts about Airbab's Insights </h4>
                    <hr>
                    <li>3 million affiliates </li>
                    <li>In 65,000 cities </li>
                    <li> In 191 countries </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Guest hosting</h2>
                <p> In one of the studies Antin and his team analyzed the company's host tools,
                    which include: 1) answers to frequently asked questions, 2) calendars to
                    organize reservation dates, 3) a control panel that reports host data (earnings,
                    views and ratings, among others) and 4) price advice. </p>
                <p> The problem is that many of these tools are difficult to understand and use. The
                    task was, then, to analyze user behavior data to decipher what and how to
                    improve. </p>
                <p> The research was not limited to large quantitative data. A team traveled to
                    strategic places, such as the United States, to conduct ethnographic field work.
                    Thus, they learned about the feelings of those who offer their homes for Airbnb
                    service. </p>
                <h2>The guests </h2>
                <p> A "check-in-along" study in New York, Bangkok and Beijing allowed the brand to
                    know what happens when guests first arrive at their chosen accommodation: </p>
                <q> We wanted to understand - Antin explained - how was being a guest like, when you
                    show up on an Airbnb: we join the guests in those countries to see what happens.
                </q>
                <p> The deep knowledge extracted from a small sample of users proved to be essential
                    to complement the available user statistical data. </p>
                <ul>
                    <h4>Research on Airbnb is divided into three roles: </h4>
                    <li>Surveys</li>
                    <li>Ethnography</li>
                    <li>Business strategy and tactics</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>"We are disorderly animals" ... and that's why we need ethnography</h2>
                <p> Antin's theory went further. In his perspective <strong>it is pertinent to
                        integrate Big Data with qualitative research :</strong>
                </p>
                <q>We want to get great answers and we certainly fight to build a great strategy.
                    And we know that, to do that, a truly holistic perspective is required (...)
                    Traveling is cross-cultural. In a large proportion of stays, the hosts and
                    guests on Airbnb speak a different first language. Just think on that alone as a
                    necessity to have a global perspective of humans. It is not only what clicks can
                    tell us, but humans what can they tell us (...) Data is powerful, but it has no
                    soul. It is necessary, but insufficient, for a good strategy and good products.
                </q>
                <p> And continued: </p>
                <q> Data and data science have a lot of information (...) They really have a rich
                    and detailed picture of what people are doing. How? and because? It is another
                    matter. In fact, I think the data (logging data, behavior data) by themselves
                    does not tell us much about how things happen, why they happen. If you want to
                    know how? and Why? You need more than data (...) We are in a design-driven
                    organization in which research is a leading voice, and our mission, which is
                    about belonging and trust, genuinely guides us. Those are human things. We are
                    messy animals, complex and volatile; Airbnb, therefore, needs a full range of
                    methodology to understand these nuances. </q>

                    <h2>Findings</h2>
                    <p> As always, some crucial observations arise here. </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Judd Antin's training is a mixture of data science, anthropology and
                            psychology. </li>
                        <li>For companies seeking actionable insights it is crucial to decipher how
                            to combine Big Data with qualitative data</li>
                        <li>In other words: the future is to combine data science with anthropology,
                            sociology, history and psychology.</li>
                        <li>... and the future is also, of course, knowing how to combine all that
                            into plans orchestrated by creative consultants.</li>
