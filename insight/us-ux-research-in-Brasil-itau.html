          <h4 class="author">This text is a translation of an excerpt from: Camila Borja and Luciano Lauri Pires, " UX Research in a
            Developing Country ", ESOMAR, Fusion, 2018.</h4> 


            
            <h2> The Brazilian context </h2>
            <p> <dfn> Brazil is a profoundly unequal country and inequality occurs at all levels. For example, regarding ethnicity and color:
                <strong> among the people with the lowest income in the country, 78.5% are black or mestizo, </strong> while than 20.8% are
                white </dfn> (source: Institute <a class="blue-marker" href="https://knoema.com/atlas/sources/IBGE?topic=Macroeconomic"> IBGE </a>
              ofGeography and Statistics)In general, Brazilians have few or no positive references regarding the administration of money.
              According to a study carried out by <a class="blue-marker" href="http://www.box1824.com.br"> Box1824 </a> with more than 2,000
              people, 97%of the sample agrees that they find it difficult to deal with their own money. In sum, <strong> the issue of money in
                banks is a taboo in Brazil, where 49% of respondents avoid even thinking about money to avoid feeling sad </strong>.</p>
            <div class="popup" onclick="myFunction()">
              <p class="highlight">¿ <strong>segments</strong> in this text?</p>
              <span class="popuptext" id="myPopup"> men and women, low income, between 12 and 55 years old. </span>
            </div>

            <h2> Digital banking </h2>
            <p>How to overcome mistrust in money and banking? Can a bank like Itaú help? With a large number of users having little financial
              knowledge, several challenges arise in the design process to create an user experience that meets the needs and desires of the
              people and that, at the sametime, is economically and technically feasible.</p>
            <p>The UX Research has helped to understand the key elements to create and evolve our digital user experience. Those elements are
              today call the seven design principles, which guide our user-centered design process.</p>
            <ul>
              <h2> 7 design principles </h2>
              <li> Digital, from start to finish </li>
              <li> Consistency to facilitate learning </li>
              <li> Customer's time is valuable </li>
              <li> Flawless, even when it fails </li>
              <li> Speak the client's language </li>
              <li> The client is in charge </li>

              </h3>

            </ul>


            <p> However, these principles are not a guarantee of success, especially in a culture with negative perceptions of money and the
              bank itself. While the visual design and user experience are fundamental for people to feel safe on a digital platform, it is
              important to ensure a in-depth knowledge of the client through different research methods. </p>

              <h2> Lightbox app </h2>
              <p>Itaú is considered a high-class bank by many Brazilians. The history of a competitive bank and the way in which the brand has
                been communicated over the years have created an image of a powerful institution, with a great affinity with technology. This
                affinity is, indeed, an important part of the growth of the company. <strong> During the 1970s and 1980s, Itaú manufactured its
                  own hardware for ATMs and personal computers </strong>. Today is the applications and websites that represent the company's
                technological vision.</p>
              <p> By 2016, most customers were already banking through apps. It was the year where the company ventured into a plan to reach out
                to low-income potential customers, considering the omnipresence of smartphones in Brazil. Smartphones provided the opportunity
                to interact with this audience and, finally, converting more people into customers.</p>

            <h2>The Goal</h2>

            <p> The idea of the study was to know how to provide a simple and intuitive channel for low-income potential customers, in order
              to increase our customer base. </p>
            <p> The challenge was taken up and led by an internal team of UX designers, sponsored by the area commercial in charge of digital
              channels. The extended team included people from marketing, visual design, customer services customer and IT. </p>

              <h2> The hypothesis </h2>
              <p> <strong> People with low incomes may be more reluctant and suspicious about the use of Itaú digital channels </strong> for
                banking. The reluctance can stem from unfamiliarity with technology and lack of affinity with brand. Suspicion may stem from
                fear of being robbed, lack of security and privacy issues; feeling that might be related to serious security problems in Brazil.
              </p>
              <h2> The method </h2>
              <p> A Design Thinking approach was used to guide the project through five main phases: exploration, synthesis, ideation,
                prototyping and testing. </p>

            <div>
              <iframe class="youtubeVideo"
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6lmvCqvmjfE?controls=0&branding=0&cc_load_policy=0&controls=0&fs=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=0&playsinline=1&quality=hd720&rel=0&showinfo=0&wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1"
                frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p> In the exploration phase, a series of in-depth interviews were conducted with more than 30 people in four geographic areas of
              Brazil. The UX researchers visited these people in their homes and passed about two hours with them, talking about their
              personal lives, their needs and their relationship with money and technology. A large amount of information, in the form of
              annotations, photos, videos, and audio recordings, was analyzed in the synthesis phase. </p>

            <span id="insight"></span>
<div class="bannerTwitero">
  <h4 style="margin-bottom: -2rem;" > The insights </h4>
  <h2> Selling and integrating: challenges of digital banking </h2>
  <p> Some crucial observations emerge here.</p>
  <ol>
    <li> <dfn> Low-income people in Brazil have very busy lives. They must work hard and, most of the time, they cannot save
        money. Many have multiple jobs that contribute to a stressful routine of commuting and long waits on public
        transport.<strong> Although this seems to be a perfect setting for a digital banking solution (one that could help them
          solve problems without having to go to a physical branch), the research showed they had a very little interest in it .
        </strong> Users had already included occasional visits to the banks premises in their routine, or they could trust someone
        to help them with payments and transfers. </dfn> </li>
    <li> Translated to the business of digital banking, the insight tells us that to massively use digital banking in low and
      low-middle segments, patient and creative financial education work is necessary </li>
    <li> Apps in this context must be hybrid (run on all interfaces and operating systems), responsive (all kinds of screens),
      simple (minimalist) and consume little data and battery; otherwise, people will see them as another economic burden and will
      erase them. </li>
    <li> People were considered to have low digital self-esteem; there was little or no familiarity with computers and smartphones
      to access banks through apps or websites. Sometimes, the family alone had just one device so family members should share it.
      In these cases, younger family members were the most active users. Illiteracy is a common problem in this segment. Many have
      little or no ability to write and read correctly, limiting their willingness to use interactive solutions based on written
      instructions, as long as reasoning and decision-making activities. </li>
    <li> Communication tools and social networks were the most relevant applications for this segment. WhatsApp is by far the most
      visited application in Brazil: from the point of view of the user experience the main reason is its voice communication
      technology. </li>
    <li> A wide variety of devices was found, from simple phones to smart devices: two important restrictions would affect any
      initiative of a digital channel in this audience: limited storage space and limited data plans to access the internet. </li>
  </ol>
