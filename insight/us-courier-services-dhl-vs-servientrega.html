    International messaging is essential for any Millennial living in a city.  Security,
      traceability
      and speed are priorities that are above cost in the mind of a typical Millenialcitizen
    . Who use the
    international messaging in this segment are people of middle or upper class, with university education and,
    Frequently, they have used this service several times, with different providers and even in different
    countries.

      business establishments. Although they contain interesting insights (based on ethnographies), the conclusions are not
      representative of the general state of the companies studied; rather they would be equivalent to the exploratory stage of a complete market study.

        <h2> A Good service is hard to find </h2>
        <p>
          I stood in the left row because it was closer to the information desktop. On my
          right two
          people were paying a shipment to Medellín; I was relieved, because the fact that there were two rows and two
          persons
          (two women) attending gave the impression of being in the middle of a safe shopping experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman who attended my row had the company uniform, although with a certain informality; and I couldn't avoid
          to notice that her blouse
          (the company blouse) was unbuttoned enough to show a second blouse and a
          chain of
          silver. The line advanced. <q> This is going to Mexico City </q>, I said, as I took a package of sheets that weighed
          roughly 1 kilo and a half
           (as I found out three days later when I went to DHL). The employee did not hesitate: <q> How much do we ask for the insurance policy? </q>
          she asked her partner on the other side. She answered: <q> for 5 thousand </q>, but after thinking about it for a moment
          remembered:
          <q> It's 50 thousand! </q>. I was surprised that they passed from one number to the other like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          They didn't weigh the package, either. Instead they ensured that they had to go through a shipment of merchandise of two
          kilos. <q> Why? </q>, I asked. <q> It is that we are intermediaries </q>. Although I did not see the relationship between both things
          
          I hastened to ask: <q> What company do you ship it with? </q>. <q> Oh, I don't remember the name </q>, said the  50
          thousand woman .
        </p>
        <p> <q> So... but I need to know which company to send it to; it is a very important package for me. </q> </p>
        <p> <q> Let me call on someone, because I don't remember. </q> </p>
        <p><q> Well.</q> </p>
        <p> <q> And ... can the guide be tracked online? </q> </p>
        <p> <q> No. It is that we are intermediaries. </q> </p>
        <p><q>...</q> </p>

        <p> She dialed and did like they did not answer; I was waiting; she continued with the gestures, as if she were
          calling on a friend and not someone in the company. It is not just any company. I will not say the name, but it is a
          long-standing organization, thousands of employees, capital, branding, marketing. By the way, the local was
          an official premise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last detail: the shipping price would be 250 thousand Colombian pesos.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> I left the premises because I was afraid of the security of my package </strong> (the corrections of a book
          that I will publish in Mexico.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I toured the mall. I did not find another courier company. I came back. The employees still remembered me.
          They gave me
          a photocopy to fill out with the data. As I filled it with resignation, I asked again for the name
          of the
          company that did the international shipping and whether they could track the guide online. <q> I don't know </q>, <q> No </q>,
          <q> is that
            we are intermediaries </q>, were the answers. Although I entered the second time willing to pay, I turned to
          go. That was it.
        </p>

          enters into the unconscious and positively reinforces the shopping experience. </figcaption>

        <p>
          Everything was consistent at the DHL premise. Even though I was an hour from my house, the subjective value of my
          package me
          convinced to make the trip; I was also convinced that the price would be a little lower, since
          I had used
          before the services of that brand. But I did not imagine that the savings would be 110 thousand pesos (and, in addition, it would have a
          number of
          guide and the assurance that my package would be at its destination two days later); I was also surprised that I was
          allowed
          record and ask research questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a country where concern for security is very high, I found myself faced with a paradox: this company
          of
          courier services offered me all the security in the world without use security as an excuse to stop my
          curiosity.
          Consumer participation in an environment of transparency is plus in our times, since
          <dfn> <strong id = "insight"> is happening
              an evolution from a passive consumer - buyer - towards <a
                href = "/ insight / b2b-lactation-room-and-productivity.html"> an active consumer, </a> who assumes the brand
              as a community
              of which it is a part. </strong> </dfn>
        </p>


        <div class = "bannerTwitero">
          <h2> What Makes us Buy </h2>
          <p> Some outstanding observations emerge here.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li> <dfn> The meaning of a customer question goes beyond the question:
                As buyers, when we ask something we are expressing <a class="blue-marker"
                  href = "/insight/brand-awareness-distroller-bogota.html"> an emotional need </a> for security and
                order: whoever achieves
                satisfying that does not win a purchase, gains affection, accompanied by ideas; those ideas, moved by those
                affections
                 spread in places like this. </dfn> </li>
            <li> Translated into the courier business, this tells us that at conquering a segment like
              Millennials of middle class the price could no so important. An international shipment is a <em> shipment of a piece of a someone's life
                </em>. The user wants to be reflected in <em> the way the service is provided </em>,
              even if it
              implies making an extra effort to buy. </li>

            <li> Where's the magic in this case? one, educated employee, two, convincing staging, three,
              coherence between what is promised and what is delivered. </li>
            <li> In the messaging business, instant transparency is essential. </li>
            <li> At DHL there was an employee; in the other two: invest in technology, logistics and experience  results
              in comparative advantages over companies that spend too much on low-skilled employees, but not
              take advantage of existing technology platforms. </li>
            <li> With this insight the national brand would gain in sales quickly: the proof is that I myself had
              paid 60% more if they had the right value proposition (even with a better
              communication would have been enough). </li>
