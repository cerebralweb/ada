        <p><em><span style="color: rgb(248, 156, 8);">In this article ❧ </span>We explore how online communities have emerged as an
            alternative to online panel research. Online
            communities  are an effective way of
            interacting with and sourcing customer insight, across a wide range of topics and business issues on a continuous basis or at
            regular intervals. In this article we analyze online communities organized by Heineken,Chobani and Zurich Insurance This is based on a WARC article (see the footnote) </em></p>

        <div class="publicidadEnArticulo" id="oculto_publicidadEnArticulo">
        </div>
        <script src="/js/us-publicidadEnArticulo.js"></script>

        <p>
          Lets' work based on questions. First, what is an online community?. I found a recent paper (see the footnote) proposing that <q>An
            online community is a qualitative research community.</q>. It's a good definition, but too short for me. Let's make a list about
          what qualitative research means in this context.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <h2>Since a qualitative approach you can do this in a online community </h2>
          <li>Interview </li>
          <li>Discourse analysis</li>
          <li>Symbolic analysis (drawings, gestures, attitudes, garment, tastes)</li>
          <li>Image analysis (pictures, memes, gifs, etc.)</li>
          <li>Behavioral analysis (videos, voice recording)
          <li>Co-creation</li>
          <li>Segmentation</li>
          <li>Prototyping and testing</li>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cool uses of online communities</h2>
        <p>
          Let's see in deep each one of the services that an Online Community can provide:
        </p>
        <h2>‘Holistic communities’ deliver insights that are fast, cheap and accurate</h2>
        <p>
          But what can you do with online communities? You can do almost whatever you want:
        </p>
        <q>
          Holistic online communities are defined by two things. First, a mixed methodology approach that uses online qual, online quant,
          usage data and physical, offline research when required. Second, a mindset focussed on delivering the answers the client needs
          rather than being wedded to particular methods or research plans, and embracing out of the ordinary research methods if required.
        </q>

        <h2>Incentives create deeper participation </h2>
        <p>
          Is it important money to attract and engaged participants ? Yes. This not a mystery, however, the problem is how to go beyond <em>likes and gift cards = mixed quality responses </em>.
        </p>

        <h2>Online communities evolved as an alternative to online panels</h2>
        <p>
          Here there is 2 super-importante things to think about: <strong>zero recruitment cost</strong> and <strong>rich insights</strong>:
        </p>
        <q>
          <dfn>Online research communities emerged as an alternative approach to traditional online access panels which are mostly one-way
            dialogue</dfn> – market researchers ask respondents to answer various surveys. In contrast, online communities offer consumers an
          opportunity to have a two-way relationship with brands which can better motivate and maintain respondents. Online research
          communities are usually <strong>closed communities</strong>, with membership open only to those invited.
        </q>
        <p>
          But, there is more: online communities can be grown (as the old online panels) and mine with data science technologies:
        </p>
        <q>
          An example of this evolution is TV network HBO in Latin America which started in 2010 with an online panel and has since evolved
          into an engaging, social-media-like online community of 40,000 people. HBO incorporate innovative technologies and methodologies
          to elicit more engagement which enables over 200 research studies a year with no recruitment costs and a quick turnaround, and
          provides better, richer insights. As well as being a platform for qualitative research, the wealth of data generated – much of it
          unstructured - has been mined for insights using supervised machine learning, data visualisation and text analysis.
        </q>

        <h2>Companies are experimenting with chatbots as community research tools</h2>

        <p>
          Can the online community environment replaced human jobs ?
          Could a bot being an online community participant ? Could it be interact with human users, enrich discussion and even help to
          understand the future of a product?
        </p>
        <q>
          Beer brand <strong>Heineken experimented with human chat-based discussion</strong> in WhatsApp. It found that it created better bonding among the
          group and led to more tangible and contextual answers for ethnographic or mission- based topics compared to blogs or forums. Its
          trial of chatbots in research communities generated similar conclusions to humans. While qualitative comments could be less rich,
          feedback was less socially-influenced, could provide more contextual data, was more accurate because of quantitative questions and
          reduced research time by 80%.
        </q>

        <h2>Online communities can help inform new product development and brand launch</h2>
        <p>
          Online communities could be a B2B internal service:
        </p>
        <q>
          Online communities can be an invaluable resource as new products reach the prototyping phase. GSK, the consumer health brand, consulted its community for in-home testing of products. The community kept journals of their experiences and reactions, and responded to recurring surveys to track their usage and satisfaction over
          time. Engagement <strong>during the prototyping phase</strong> gave GSK time to modify everything from websites to ingested product formulations, and to benefit from the long-term interaction with real consumers, in a naturalistic context, prior to product launch. Finally, during both the product's pre-launch phase and immediately post-launch, GSK has benefitted from the experience and organic advocacy of early users.
          Meanwhile, Santander Bank, the Spanish financial services group, has leveraged the views of an online community of consumers and
          staff to help build its brand in America. The firm built a community of 600 consumers and 300 employees, and built a long term
          relationship with participants over an 18-month period. The community provided a number of key insights feeding into the Santander
          brand positioning, value proposition and advertising strategy in the run up to launching its brand in the country. The community
          also developed core insights which fed in to product development, as the emphasis this group placed on being rewarded for loyalty
          fed into the creation of the extra 20 checking account, which gives users $20 a month for completing certain actions.
        </q>

        <h2>Online communities are a natural fit for co-creation and crowdsourced ideas</h2>
        <p>
          Are online communities a part of democratization or enfranchisement of consumers?
        </p>
        <q>
          LEGO consults an active and innovative user community to help keep an eye on trends for new products and
          product innovation. Its online crowdsourcing platform, Cuusoo, engages with what's known as AFOLs – "Adult Fans of LEGO". LEGO
          fans are invited to submit their product design ideas via a dedicated website. Once the idea gets 10,000 votes from other fans, it
          gets presented to a LEGO review board. If successful, it will go into production. However, once an idea has been approved fans can
          be quite impatient; they tend to expect the development process to move quickly. But in reality, these things take time.
        </q>

        <h2>Online community management can engage passionate fans & improve customer service</h2>
        <q>
          Chobani, the US Greek yoghurt brand, became number one in its category without relying upon traditional advertising. Instead it
          focused on social media with the aim of creating a passionate fanbase online. Initial interaction with consumers via social media
          progressed from a customer service function to active community management around different shared interests of customers.
          Communities allowed customers to play an active role in moulding the brand via a continuous <strong>feedback loop informing product
            development,</strong> as well as creating relevant content and experiential activities. By taking community management in -house the
          Chobani team were afforded the agility and intimacy to build and sustain a relationship with their core customer base.
        </q>
        <h2>Online communities can enable companies to be more customer centric in focus</h2>
        <p>
          Feel costumers more attracted by online communities ?
        </p>
        <q>
          Zurich Insurance set up an online community ZCom to mine customer insight, with the ultimate aim to create a better customer
          experience. Zurich faced a need to innovate, with increasing demands from customers, as well as emerging competitive threats from
          innovative fintech start up's. In addition, the Life Insurance industry is technically complex, with many requirements which often
          take precedence over the needs of the customer. A small pilot community was set up in Hong Kong, and now operates across 7
          markets. The community is focused on 3 key areas including; feedback on existing ideas from specific customer segments, iterative
          proposition development & engaging hard to reach customers such as HNWI. ZCom reaches the most senior members of the business
          allowing customer centricity to be championed across the organisation.
        </q>
        <p>
          It is worth to recall the 4 points of David Aaker:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Brand name awareness</li>
          <li>Brand loyalty</li>
          <li>Perceived quality</li>
          <li>Brand associations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Zurich Insurance approach contributes to all of them, but especially to the second one, since online communities provide and
          easy, closed and confidential way to be engaged with important costumers and segments
        </p>
