                <p> HAVING AN APARTMENT is an essential concern of every middle-class Latin American citizen. Nowadays
                  more than 70
                  % of the region's population lives in cities with more than one million inhabitants, and at least
                  50% are
                  paying for a home or are in the process of acquiring it. The cost of real estate, however,
                  is it so
                  high that <strong> horizontal property is practically the only solution for the urban middle classes in
                    the region. </strong> </p>
                <p> In this article we present a case study. These are <strong> two families with whom we developed a
                  qualitative investigation</strong>
                     whose objective was to observe the feelings of the consumer of real estate credit.</p>
                <p> The main obstacle that the probable buyer of this type of credit faces is himself.
                  <strong> Impulses
                    of consumption that a person has daily can end up sabotaging (or precipitating) the acquisition
                    of a real estate credit </strong>.
                  <p> The markets set certain conditions such as the price of credit or the shortage of potential buyers,
                    but it is the
                    probable buyer who somehow decides how much of her income will go to that ambiguous object that is
                    the
                    a savings account. How do consumers who need real estate credit get around this problem? With what
                    Practices of
                    consumption does savings collide? <strong> How to value the experience of saving from the point of view of
                      financial services
                      and real estate? </strong> </p>

                <p> AT A DISTANCE Fredy looks like any merchandise dealer.  Every morning he gets up at 1am
                    for
                    have breakfast, put on a white butcher suit and drive a van full of
                    raw chickens.
                  It ends at noon. By that time he has already distributed more than three hundred kilos of breasts and legs throughout
                  the
                  city. The last stop is at my house. On one occasion I intercepted him with an unusual request: "I just saw
                  that you supply the
                  chicken to Doña Fulanita's store, would you mind to sell it directly to me? ". His first reaction was to tell me that Doña
                  
                 was going to be upset at that, but then - as I asked for his card, aware that exchanging cards is key
                  in
                  any business - he thought about it and answered "we look there". </p>
        
                <p> Sometimes he travels with the oldest of his daughters, either because he is on vacation or because he has picked her up at the
                  school. She is a girl of about 11 years; It isn't gonna take long to go to university. In its
                  profile picture on Whatsapp
                  I see that, in addition, he has another girl, a little younger, and a wife. </p>
        
                <p> It seems to me a miracle that he doesn't fall asleep while driving, but - according to him - <strong> has become accustomed to
                    sleep during the
                    day </strong>, contrary to what most human beings do. But it's going
                  well. I want to think so. </p>
        
                <p> I think Fredy, his dotters and his wife are a middle class family. They have a business as prosperous as possible,
                  a
                  Reasonably large family, vehicle, and premises. So <strong> it is not strange that they want to acquire a
                    new house </strong>. The
                  apartment in which they live has just two bedrooms and is in a noisy and unwelcoming area. </p>
        
                <p> <strong> Despite the small and fragile prosperity, he is not yet a candidate for a loan.
                    real estate </strong>. First of all, he has not finished to pay the mortgage of his current apartment, and the
                  proven income - and the fact that it originates from a small business - does not allow him to achieve the score
                  necessary for the amount that would be required if
                  he wants to buy a small house or a bigger apartment (more than double than his current apartment worth). </p>

        <p>The answer of <a class="blue-marker" href="https://bit.ly/2tkIbke">Davivienda</a> appreciated his request to "operate" a credit
          with the brand, and alluded to the
          "investigation" of an "accounting department" that had made the technical decision. In the third paragraph they
          invited to
          invest the savings in a CDT. There the letter ended.</p>

          

         
  
          <p> That was in November. In December Fredy decided that they were going on vacation to the
            Beach. <strong> He had not forgotten that weeks before he had agreed with his wife to continue saving, waiting
              patiently the
              time for a new request to Davivienda </strong>. Nor had he forgotten that several months ago
            they had been
            going out on Sunday expeditions with his family looking for notices of for sale. </p>
  
          <p> Those tours always ended with a list that included various places promoted by <a class = "blue-marker"
                href = "https://www.portafolio.co/negocios/empresas/andante-rv-inmobiliaria-hablo-le-espera-sector-edificador-pais-497239"> RV </a>
              , a well-known real estate firm in the capital. In one of the appointments with an agent of that
            company found a house whose price
            and conditions made them excited. The following Monday, Fredy and his wife began the request to Davivienda.
          </p>

          <p> Fredy had not forgotten anything. It only occurred to him that the start of the new saving cycle could be postponed
             for a few months; after the holidays.
          </p>
  
          <ul>
            <h2> Why real estate companies don't have better
              escort services? </h2>
  
            <li> The "sale" of a property is considered to begin when the buyer makes an offer, and not
              when the consumer is developing the process of saving and exploring the market. </li>
            <li> What is not "sale" is covered with physical or virtual publications, which are not subject to systems of
              high quality. </li>
            <li> There is no research on how to use technology beyond posting notices on websites. For example, few
              real estate
              they develop apps, an option that could have an impact at low cost, let's say in the area of ​​pedagogy for
              acquisition
              of real estate. </li>
            <li> The same goes for banks, which do invest in software development but only for administration
              of
              portfolios: there is no perceived potential value in offering educational services for potential
              users. </li>
            <li> The real estate market is profitable in the present, as it works: it is assumed that in the future it will continue
              being profitable as if the
              current game conditions could not change. </li>
          </ul>

            href="https://twitter.com/paulo_leon">@paulo_leon</a> </figcaption>


            <p> AT her 49 YEARS OLD Elsa still lives with her mother. "No one has ever thought about me as a single woman --she says--, 
              because I had my first daughter when I was 17". Then she had two other girls with her current boyfriend, a man 
              twenty older that is married (and not with her, in case there are doubts). </p>

            <p> The house in which she lives is part of a large house built in the 1960s by her father, an former worker of
              Bavaria, a very well known Colombian company. "I don't know why he built it with rooms that communicate with each other but not with the hallway.
              It is like
              if he thought that some of her daughters were going to need the room for living
              - Explains - "But these are not apartments. They do not have a bathroom, kitchen or separate exits."
              <strong> Elsa has
                felt as protected as lacking privacy </strong>. Her mother controls - without any drama - her
              schedules, friendships and
              raising their girls; It is as if instead of being three daughters there were four.
             </p>
            <p> It is amazing what "owning" a house can mean for a person. <strong> Elsa was willing
                to pay it in 20
                or 25 years: it would be completely hers only in her last years </strong>. In exchange for sharing with the bank the
              legal ownership would
              the property of her life and the direction of her family be in her for the first time. <strong> That's why I wanted the credit. </strong> </p>

            <p> <strong> When the BBVA bank approved her request, she felt an unknown happiness </strong>. The experts in
              psychology of
              consumer say that it is almost impossible to determine the degree of satisfaction of a person, but the gesture that
              Elsa did
              while she was telling me really transmitted to me the uniqueness of that event in her life. 
            </p>

            <p> "I stopped going on vacation so long that I lost count of the years." <strong> I wonder how he did
                Elsa to postpone
                the little perks of so many vacations </strong> to focus on the infinite patience that is
              needed to achieve the goal: not the home
              ownership: a credit. Incidentally, describing this willingness to save as "infinite patience" is not pure romanticism, but a way to put 
              into words a particularly arduous experience of consumption. </p>
    
            <p> Her family context and gender are essential to understand her consumption preferences. <dfn> <strong> In
                  the
                  Research on microeconomics and <em> behavioral economics </em> has prevailed the idea that women
                  tend to
                  be less risky than men to make economic decisions </strong>. </dfn> That, without a doubt, is
              one of the causes.
            </p>

            <p> Elsa represents herself as "a female head of a family", who has a partner with whom she cannot
              form a
              conventional family. So, somehow, she feels like she had to try "twice as hard." <strong> That
                 perception
                 also helped her to defer satisfying more immediate consumption impulses that
                would have deviated  her from the strategic consumption goal </strong>. </p>

              <h2> Insights </h2>
              <li> <dfn> Our study shows that some people will behave emotionally, rather than rationally,
                  at the 
                  time to make financial consumption decisions. But why? Some
                  people drop out
                  the idea of ​​obtaining a loan in a close period of time because, despite fulfilling
                  with almost all the requirements: they simply do not have a sufficient financial education </dfn>. </li>
              <li> Two: gender matters. Certain
                Financial decisions are understood by examining the identity that people have built around what
                 means being a man or a woman. Many clients make decisions following more or less unconscious scripts:
                <em> a man would pay this way or that way, a woman would handle money in this or that way. </em> </li>
              <li> Three: the credit market would benefit from programs to promote credit practices
                like team work in families, so families make more rational decisions
                 and are more consistent over time. The perception of savings that users have could also
                be the object of
                financial education by banks and real estate </li>
