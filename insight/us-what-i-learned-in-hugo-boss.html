                    The consumer world is not the ordered world of Big Data. Sell and buy are
                         ambivalent acts that require interpretation. If you are happy with

                <p> When I turned 39 my wife wanted to give me a shirt. That weekend
                    we went to a Hugo Boss store in Bogotá. When we entered the premises she left the
                    a young man in his twenties passed, thin, well-groomed and wearing a suit to
                    measure. What the seller did reminded me that <strong> buying is more than
                        buy. </strong> First he analyzed my shoes (a good observer always
                    starts with the shoes), then tried to determine what brand of pants he wore,
                    noticed if you wore an expensive watch (no); finally, he saw my shirt. But actually
                    it was not the last: all the time I would be going back and forth on that information
                    to interpret how to serve me. Excellent: my seller was acting
                    exactly how it should act. </p>
                <p> I also had to act as a buyer. I entered the premises as if <em> no </em>
                    it was the first time I entered - and bought - something of the brand (point to
                    me). I entered accompanied by a foreigner (point for me, in a culture of
                    consumption that still overvalues ​​the presence of the foreigner), my shoes
                    they were a little worn but not old, and they were quite informal (minus a
                    period), but they were from the latest adidas collection (plus one); while the
                    salesman observed me I spoke and my way of speaking transmitted something: that I am
                    a "cultured" person and an experienced buyer (two points for me). </p>
                <h2> To buy is to place an expectation in the other </h2>
                <p> Perhaps without being very aware of it, the seller <em> was listening </em> my way
                    to speak, so that I could enrich that quick interpretation of myself
                    clothing. What use was it? Much, then, almost without intending to
                    <strong> was able to decide "the right words" to reinforce his
                        sales strategy. </strong> Let's reverse the analysis for a moment to see
                    to what extent the way we talk influences a sale. If the seller
                    he would have spoken to me as "nero" what would have been my reaction: at least one
                    sly smile. </p>
                <p> - Hi, I want to see a white long-sleeved shirt for men. </p>
                <p> - Armholes. </p>
                <p> I exaggerate. Saying "desire" or "male" would have been aspirational or anachronistic, and
                    <strong> that would have devalued me as a buyer </strong> of Hugo Boss. Whatever,
                    if my seller had said sisas, coriander, simcard, cindirella, simón, or
                    any of the other popular variations of a yes I would have felt
                    disappointed; A mere word would have introduced too much noise. </p>

                    <p class="highlight">¿ <strong>segments</strong> mentioned in this article</p>

                </div>
                <h2> What is buying? </h2>
                <p> Buying is more than choosing something and paying for it. Buying is a social act: it involves
                    our relationships with others, emotions, memories and previous learning.
                    <strong> My visit to Hugo Boss's place felt like something far from emotions
                        like anger, </strong> fear or sadness and very close to feelings
                    like love. Five years ago, on a fresh, open sky morning, Carmen and
                    I got married in a Mexican hotel: I was wearing a full Hugo Boss outfit.
                    In my buyer's memory <em> that </em> was important, that association between a
                    happy event and the use of a brand. </p>
                <p> In marketing, people usually talk about the 80/20 rule. Although this refers to
                    middle class and consumer markets like the North American I think that also
                    It applies to specific segments and niches in a city like Bogotá. <strong> The
                        80/20 rule says that 20% of a brand's customers buy 80% of
                        your products </strong>. Maybe it's an exaggeration or something that shouldn't be
                    taken literally but there are cases where the ratio is even more
                    Low: 1.2% of Budweiser customers in the US account for 80%
                    of your sales. </p>

                <div class="bannerTwitero">
                    <p> This  little <a href="/pdfs/cualitativeResearchByHexis.pdf" class="blue-marker"> gift </a>
                        might help to grok what buy is. </p>
                </div>
                <p> Merchandise has a powerful influence on the people who buy it.
                    Shopping is a powerful act of communication between
                    a person and an object. Most <strong> pieces of advertising that
                        we see have little relation to the real qualities of the products:
                    </strong> and it works. We buy for what we associate with the purchased object
                    (remember that it was <em> my wife </em> who wanted to give me the shirt), because
                    we need to express what we are, or what we want to be, through it (for
                    example, I'm a husband, Hugo Boss purchase, like a mantra). Although
                    the merchandise has physical qualities that we certainly look at
                    (I know a Hugo Boss shirt is made to last and look good during a
                    decade or more) those qualities function as a vehicle or a material support
                    of the meaning of the purchase (my wife buys me the shirt because she loves me). </p>

                <h2> Purchases and hormones </h2>
                <p> Sometimes shopping makes me happy. The purchase therefore becomes something special in
                    my life: <strong> <dfn> buying helps to endorse who we are and what we want
                            to be </dfn>. </strong> It is almost the same, but not the same. If you buy
                    becomes particularly important for a certain segment of consumers it may be
                    that that special act of buying has become painfully
                    special. That pain usually arises because the distance between what
                    consumers are <em> and what they want to be </em> is great; and if such a distance
                     becomes large enough the pain turns into frustration and
                    resentment. <dfn> When people can't buy what they think they are
                        they become people who protest </dfn>. Is there any doubt that Chile,
                    Colombia, Argentina or Brazil would see less animosity in the streets of their
                    cities if they were societies with fully established middle classes? </p>

                <div class="bannerTwitero">
                    <h2> Why are political crises relevant to the shopper's analysis?
                    </h2>
                    <ol>

                        <li> Trademarks are public references of identity </li>
                        <li> During crises, collective thinking is more likely to change the
                            meaning of things: things like marks that can be put
                            on a pedestal, or repudiated, from one day to the next; a political party
                            it is also a brand </li>
                        <li> People always expect their symbolic referents to shed light on
                            problems. Brands are as important references as the
                            religion or politics. </li>

                <h2> The satisfaction in the purchase </h2>
                <p> Satisfaction is difficult to study. Determine if a person really stayed
                    Satisfied requires approaches from various perspectives. A couple of days ago
                    I manage to solve something at a local bank. The experience was, let's say,
                    Really good. Hours later I received an email with a title somewhat
                    Orwellian: "We know you were at our branch." They wanted me to fill
                    a satisfaction survey! </p>
                <ul>
                    <h2> Surveys and their destinations </h2>
                    <p> I wondered, then, what to do. I said to myself: </p>
                    <li> Option 1: I interrupt the reading of my other emails. I read the various lines
                        from "email marketing" (there are still people who pay Mailchimp for that). I make
                        click on the button. I wait for your page to load. While the charge ends
                        imagined me accepting one of the consumer credits that automated calls
                         offer me weekly. I carefully fill in each question
                        (Plato - I remembered - believed that the entire life of a philosopher would be dedicated
                        to the solution of <em> one </em> single question.). In conclusion: no, the option
                        1 was not an option. </li>
                    <li> Option 2: fill out the survey quickly. Consequences: poor quality data and
                        guilty customer for supplying false information
                        (Do you want people to associate your brand with those emotions?). </li>
                    <li> Option 3: I don't fill out the survey (my choice). Consequences: bad data
                        quality and annoyed customer. </li>
                </ul>
                <p> Hugo Boss never sent out surveys. They did not need it, as follows from the
                    first paragraphs of this chronicle of consumption. (I wonder if anyone in the
                    BBVA's marketing department buys shirts at Hugo Boss.) Some brands
                     approach to satisfaction in a more realistic way. Penney - the American retailer
                     - send researchers to observe and come along with 50 women during
                    several days. They wanted to know what their lives were, on a daily basis, and how they used
                    products that the brand could offer in its stores, which meant
                    observe how they bought, how they ate, what they cooked, etc. </p>
                <p> Some economists believe that <strong> satisfaction is inversely
                        proportional to the frequency </strong> with which something is consumed. When my
                    wife and I go to a mall we walk little and slowly. The reason is
                    that we only go to buy. </p>

                        <li> The world of consumers is not the ordered world of Big Data.
                            Selling and buying are ambivalent acts that require
                            <strong> interpretation </strong>. If you are content with the literalness of
                            Big Data get ready for surprises </li>
                        <li> We have evolved from consumers in mass markets (the
                            markets that emerged after World War II) to
                            "diverse" consumers, in multiple segments, markets and
                            micro-markets; the new generations of consumers have tastes and
                            shopping habits politicized with the discourse of green or
                            discontent over growing social inequality </li>
                        <li> Smart advertising reduces the current buyer uncertainty
