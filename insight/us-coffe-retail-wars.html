        <h2> Fancy Coffee </h2>
        <p> Tostao is turning the traditional coffee date in Bogotá upside down. In your premises you can
          check that
          some of the dominant brands' clientele is gone, or at least experimenting with the new
          option
          of consumption. The Hexis research team set out to observe for several weeks a group of
          clerks, who are regular costumers of the cafes. In
          that fieldwork we were able to verify that the choice of a lower priced product does not necessarily
          explained
          because of the size of the wallet. The challenge is to understand <strong> why a particular segment is been seduced, when not long ago they preferred to go to Oma or Juan Valdez
            . </strong> Did the demand change? Has the costmer budget been restructured? Was the effectiveness of the
          Tostao's Framing what
          caused such movement? </p>


        <h2 id="brand"> Bogotano coffee </h2>

        <p> There was a time when the cityzens of Bogotá did not drink coffee but chicha. Coffee was a drink of
          extravagant people who met to talk about smart things, politics, business.
           When <strong>the
            beer replaced chicha </strong>among the working classes, the small Bogota middle class preferred the
             distinction of "going to the cafe".  People who had gone to college drank coffee, not beer. (Actually
          they drank both things: in the end, coffee had an air of <a class="class2" for them
             href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption"> sophistication </a>
          that the beer compensated with relaxation, and noise). </p>

        <p> There was another time - a long one - when each social group was adopting its own style of going to the cafe. The
          
          wealthy people drank coffee in a club, or in a place sufficiently expensive or remote; while the others
           used to take it in "the cafeteria": at that time both the worker, the janitor, the usher, the
          secretary
          as the businessman they <strong> took "un perico" or "un tinto", but in different ways and in different places
            <em> different </em> </strong>,
          of course it was. </p>
        <p> And there was another time - more recent - when brands like Oma and Juan Valdéz appeared. <strong> Their model
            business was to create
            a local version of Starbucks, </strong> one that interpreted the famous Colombian coffee  as a product
          who could also
          be sold in the cities of the country that produced it, and not only in Europe and the United States. And there
          it changed again the way of understanding what "going to the cafe" was: it was not only about entrepreneurs with a new
          idea, but also new <strong>middle classes growing and demanding new forms of consumption.</strong> </p>

        <p> And now we are in another era, when the market turned upside down again. It is a bit like
          the revenge of the
          chicha. The reader will remember that three paragraphs ago it was said that chicha was replaced by
          beer.
          The businessmen simply decided that an industrial drink should replace an artisanal one, which
          hardly
          they manufactured. Although in those years there was no talk on marketing, marketing consisted of arguing
            that the chicha
            - a cheap fermented drink that was taken in improvised containers and in quantities not
            controlled-- <strong> it wasn't
            hygienic </strong> nor typical of civilized nations and cities, as was the beer, which came out
          ordered in
          bottles - the contents of which were measured and labeled -, mathematically arranged in boxes, and distributed by
          properly identified trucks,
          that carried quantities of boxes determined by what would be called "a distribution chain". Well
          ,
          Tostao is like a business chica. The following section explains why. </p>

        <h2> A Blue Ocean </h2>
        <p> <dfn> Tostao is to put the experience of "going to the cafe" within the scope of low income clerks, and
              enhance it with a cheap bakery portfolio. </dfn> </p>
        <p> So that, the specific value propositions in Tostao are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Make a hybrid between the neighborhood bakery and the Starbucks coffee. </li>
          <li> Contrary to appearances, Tostao's model is not based exclusively on the law of demand (the lower the price the more the buyers); It is also based on a very fashionable marketing framing: the
            democratization
            Of something. </li>
          <li> Tostao joins brands that want to "democratize" something, in their case coffee (and now wine). </li>
          <li> A highly diversified product portfolio. </li>
          <li> If a store sells a lot, they open another one nearby. </li>
          <li> By the end of 2019 Tostao will have more than 400 stores, and the economic stagnation will bring
            more clientele from ""middle" income segments</li>
          <li> They only expand to cities with a mass market. </li>
        </ul>


        <q> "[Oma's coffee] It is richer than the other [Tostao], but the other makes up for it" [the other?] "The
          price (...) but also the variety that one finds in the fridge (...) "

        <h2> The Framing of Tostao </h2>

        <p> <dfn> The consumer buys the best he can. You just need to clarify what it means to be able to buy
            something and how to
            define what is "the best" in each purchasing context. </dfn> </p>
        <p> First of all: <strong> Does Tostao sell cheap coffee?  </strong> No, Tostao sells coffee cheaper than
            Oma, Juan Valdéz and Starbuks, but also sells coffee as expensive - sometimes more expensive - than many
            bakeries, cigarette shops and
          street sales; in fact <a class="blue-marker"
             href="https://www.semana.com/economia/articulo/como-surgio-tostao-cafe-y-pan/551386"> a
            Sinnetic's recent report </a> stated that Tostao's impact may be felt more in
          the informal economy. (Here <a class="blue-marker"
             href="https://www.sinnetic.com/sinnetic-presenta-su-proyeccion-de-crecimiento-economico-2018-basada-en-big-data/"> el
            report </a>.) </p>
        <p> <dfn> When prices and budgets change the consumption of goods also change </dfn>. Tostao has contributed
          with more than
          1,500 employees and 300 stores to change the price of "going out for coffee." At the same time, the economy
          Colombian
          is in a period of recession, VAT, fuels went up, that is, there has certainly been an adjustment
          in the
          budgets of families, especially the low and middle income segments (where the framing of
          Tostao). </p>

        <p> In summary: <strong> playing with price and tight budgets is at the heart of the strategy of
            Tostao </strong>. </p>

        <p> Being able to buy a coffee could mean saving money. Consumers are not always aware of being
          saving or wasting money. Perhaps what they feel ends up to be more important. Tostao is
            clear on this:
            the austerity of its facilities (there are no chairs or tables, for example) immediately makes you feel like you are
            there to save. However, when comparing their prices with those of the informal bakeries, savings become
            relative.  </p>

        <p> <dfn> The coffee buyer must feel that he saves in these times, but at the same time he needs to feel
            that is
            acquiring enough value. </dfn> Tostao has an answer to this expectation: standardization,
          uniformity, or, in
          in other words, a branding, a brand construction, which is a soft version of Oma, Juan Valdéz or
          Starbucks, and
          a much more robust version of artisan branding (didn't we just invent it?) of
            bakeries and cigar shops.
          neighborhood. </p>


        <h2> What is <em> Framing </em>? </h2>

        <p> <dfn> How things are presented to consumers, that is the "Framing". </dfn> Brands must
          --in theory-- to sell what people want to buy. So marketing and advertising are like
          additional layers companies put on products to convince buyers, although the
          contents. 
          Advertising and marketing do not necessarily increase the intrinsic value of something: not because the commercial
          from Old
          Spice is funny (my cousin laughs over and over at the same spot) his deodorant is going to
          to get better. </p>
        <p> Incidentally, consumers are more likely to be influenced by marketing and
          advertising when
          their choices are constrained by uncertainty: <span id="ethno"> uncertainty </span> is so obvious in our local environment and
          worldwide. </p>


        <h2> Ethnography: 4 Tostao fans </h2>

        <p> It is said that if a consumer hesitates when buying something, it is because he is in a process of
          discovery: "Could it be that
          I do need this? "Will I buy it again?" "What do I feel when I'm buying it?"</strong>. It happens
          with a tomato, a
          coffee, a car and even with the Mayor (when you go to vote you are making a consumption decision). </p>
        <p> On the 24th, at seven thirty in the morning, Paulo - our ethnographer - took the bus that
          
          would lead him to the North Station. Then he took the route D10, sat in a blue chair (neither elderly nor
          pregnant women appeared), and after a few stops descended at the Virrey stop. Not
          far from there he met the marketing director of a supply firm for
          restaurants. What the company wanted to know has nothing to do with this report. The thing is that the
            commission involved
            do field work in various cafes in the city, including Tostao. </p>



          <p> One day Paulo was buying his own coffee in a Tostao on the "Carrera 24" and "Calle 63", when
            a scary laugh
            made him turn. It was a woman of about 55 years who was drinking a coffee with three other clients. Since he had been
            there several times there he realize that it was the same group that he had seen before. The most striking thing, however, was that he had also seen them in an
              Oma premise nearby. </strong> </p>

          <p> Without hesitation, Paulo decided to approach to the group. After introducing himself, he made conversation with them
            about the.
            ethnography, the study of the consumer and coffee, and proposed to interview them. He didn't even have to.
            invite them the next coffee. </p>


          <q> "With what he bought me an OMA coffee he bought me a much bigger coffee and a bread or a cookie"
          </q>
          <figcaption> Josefina, 39, married, one daughter, teacher of ethics and religion in a school
            , owns a house in Chía, has a specialization in sex education. </figcaption>

          <p> It turned out that all four were employees of a Jesuit school that was also in the area. The woman of
            the
            scary laugh was an accountant and had no family other than her mother (she lived with the first in Cedritos). Their
            pals were two teachers and the "Discipline Coordinator". One was the teacher of Ethics, religion, lived
            in Chía and she was married with a soccer player retired early due to a skull injury; they have a daughter
            (which
            she rarely saw awake, as much of her life is spent in the traffic between Bogotá and Chía). The other
            teacher is a non-practicing engineer who dictates biology and lives in an old apartment in La soledad with
            its
            wife (childless). The "Discipline Coordinator", although chatty, did not comment much about himself, but
            it was obvious that
             is about to retire. </p>

          <p> After the first conversation, Paulo and the group of happy diners agreed to continue meeting in the
            following weeks
            to talk about coffee and its tastes. Some of the issues discussed were why did they switch from Oma to
            Tostao?
            What did they feel it was ease? Will the change be permanent? <strong></strong> What could Oma do to
              get them back? </strong> What could Tostao do
             to retain them?  </p>

            <h2> Insight </h2>
            <p> Tostao is to put the experience of "going to the cafe" within the reach of low and "middle" income, and
              add a bakery portfolio. Their main challenge is to selectively improve their facilities so that
              he
              Experimental consumption of mid clerks is transformed into a constant consumption. 
            </p>
              <p> To drink coffee is to put something in your stomach, but without "gain weigh"; drinking coffee is not eating
                something, it is a
                experience of
                sociability, relaxation and energy acquisition for a hard day at work. </p>
